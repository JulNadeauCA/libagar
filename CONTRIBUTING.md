#### **Try Csoft.net Hosting**

The Canadian based [Csoft.net Hosting](https://csoft.net) Company, which first advertised on Slashdot back in 1998, has been providing funding and resources for developing Agar since the start of the project. Now located in New York City, csoft.net's servers still offer secure, high-performance Unix hosting on dedicated servers starting from $5/month.
