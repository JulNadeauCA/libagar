## How to contribute to Agar

#### **Reporting bugs**

Please use the [Agar Bugzilla](https://bugs.csoft.net/enter_bug.cgi?product=Agar)
to report bugs. You can also open up a GitHub issue, contact the
[maintainer](mailto:vedge@hypertriton.com), or post to the
[Agar Mailing List](https://mail231.csoft.net/lists/listinfo/agar).

#### **Submitting patches**

Casual contributors can submit patches using the
[Bugzilla](https://bugs.csoft.net/enter_bug.cgi?product=Agar)
or by sending an e-mail to maintainer or the mailing list.

More frequent contributors can request a developer account with write access
to the [Main Repository](https://dev.csoft.net). Note: Using GitHub pull
requests is not preferable because active development takes place on the main
subversion repository.

#### **Purchasing commercial support**

You do not need to purchase a license in order to use Agar in commercial
applications and we do not require any kind of compensation, but if you find
Agar useful, we hope that you will consider signing up for
[commercial support](http://libagar.org/lists.html).

#### **Try Csoft.net Hosting for Free**

The [Csoft.net Hosting](https://csoft.net) Company, which first advertised on
Slashdot back in 1998, has been providing the the funding and resources
necessary in developing Agar since the very beginning of the project.
Now located in New York City, Csoft.net provides physically secure,
non-virtualized Unix hosting with unrestricted SSH access and gigabit
transfer rates for as low as $5 a month.

#### **Buy Items from ElectronTubeStore.com**

Our newest sponsor, [ElectronTubeStore](https://electrontubestore.com)
provides raw materials, useful parts and components. ElectronTubeStore
ships worldwide, quickly and economically. If you are looking for a reputable
supplier for a specific chip, transistor, vacuum tube, connector, hard to find
material, or any metal alloy in any shape, check out ElectronTubeStore.com.

#### **Donating hardware**

We are always interested in porting Agar to new hardware platforms, operating
systems and devices. Please contact the maintainer if you wish to donate
hardware.
