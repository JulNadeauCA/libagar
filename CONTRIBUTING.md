Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JulNadeauCA/libagar/issues/) or the [Bugzilla](https://bugs.csoft.net/enter_bug.cgi?product=Agar) to report bugs. You can also contact [Julien](mailto:vedge@csoft.net), post to the [Agar Mailing List](https://mail231.csoft.net/lists/listinfo/agar) or write to the [Discord channel](https://libagar.org/discord).

#### **Purchasing commercial support**

You do not need to purchase a license in order to use Agar in commercial applications and we do not require any kind of compensation, but if you find it useful, we hope that you will consider signing up for [commercial support](https://libagar.org/lists.html).

#### **Try Csoft.net Hosting**

The Canadian-based [Csoft.net](https://csoft.net), which first advertised on [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org) back in 1998, has been supporting the Agar project since the beginning. With its new server farm located in New York City, the same team still works every day to provide secure, high-performance Unix hosting.
