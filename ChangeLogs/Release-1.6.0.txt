Release Notes for Agar 1.6.0 (Nullability Complete)
---------------------------------------------------

Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.5.0, in no
particular order.

- Introduce Agar memory models: AG_SMALL, AG_MEDIUM & AG_LARGE. The memory
  model can be set at build time using --with-memory-model. SMALL targets
  8- and 16-bit machines with KBs of RAM and up to 4096 colors. The MEDIUM
  and LARGE models target both 32- and 64-bit machines. MEDIUM can handle
  24-bit "true color" (32-bit with alpha). LARGE adds support for 48-bit
  "deep color" (64-bit with alpha).
- GUI: Add support for 16-bit per component "deep color" under AG_LARGE.
       48-bit display works with the glx, wgl and cocoa drivers.
- GUI: AG_Surface(3) now handles 48- and 64-bit surfaces. PNG files with
       16-bit per channel are now supported by the PNG loader/exporter.
- GUI: AG_Surface(3) now handles 1-bit (monochrome), 2-bit (4-color),
       and 4-bit (16 color) palettized modes. Add PixelsPerByte to format.
- GUI: Add Grayscale+Alpha modes to AG_Surface(3). Supports 32-bit (16-bit
       value + 16-bit alpha) and 64-bit (32-bit value + 32-bit alpha).
- GUI: Pack AG_PixelFormat in AG_Surface (the `format' field is no longer
       a pointer but the AG_PixelFormat itself).
- CORE: Updated Ada bindings (ada/core). Overloading and class registration
        now allows pure Ada implementations of new Agar object classes.
- CORE: Added --enable-type-safety option (implied by --enable-debug).
- CORE: Introduce AG_{Copy,Write,Skip}StringPadded() for fixed-length records.
- CORE: Introduce AG_DelTimers().
- CORE: Introduce AG_Web(3), a multiprocess HTTP/1.1 application server. It
        handles authentication, session/process management, push events and
        templates. Not enabled by default (must compile with --enable-web).
- CORE: Add AG_SetErrorS() variant; avoid printf use by AG_FatalError().
- CORE: Remove unnecessary locks in AG_WriteString().
- CORE: Document AG_Db(3) API.
- VG: Fix invalid access under GUI-less operation.
- VG: Fix invalid access in VG_View(3).
- Add missing include for 32-bit MSYS build. Thanks varialus!
- Manual page improvements (clarity, wording, added more examples).
- GUI: add AG_ClipLine for clipping lines to rectangular bounding boxes
- GUI: add AG_ClipLineCircle for clipping lines to circular regions
- GUI: add AG_DrawArrowhead for drawing arrowheads of arbitrary size and angle
  aligned to arbitrary vectors
- GUI: add AG_GetLineIntersection for computing the intersection of two line
  segments
- GUI: add new gui_math functions: AG_Square, AG_HaveQuadraticSolution,
  AG_QuadraticPositive, AG_QuadraticNegative, AG_Distance
- GUI: add AG_DrawArrowLine for drawing lines with arrowheads
- GUI: AG_Graph now supports directed graphs
