What is AgarWM?
-----------------
AgarWM is a stand-alone window manager built on top of the Agar GUI. It
is designed to allow application logic and GUI mechanics to execute in
two different processes. See the manual page, agarwm(1) for a detailed
description of the protocol.

There is a sample AgarWM application called "wm-hello" in the demos
directory.

How do I use AgarWM?
--------------------
If you are using the X window system, edit your ~/.xinitrc file to
contain:

	exec agarwm

And then start X using startx(1).
