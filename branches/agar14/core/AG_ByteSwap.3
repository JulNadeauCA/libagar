.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_ByteSwap
.Nd agar byte swapping macros
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core/byteswap.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These macros swap the order of bytes in 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit words (if
supported). 
They are useful when reading or writing data of a specific endianness.

The functions
.Fn AG_Swap16 ,
.Fn AG_Swap32
and
.Fn AG_Swap64
return the given value with the byte order reversed.
.Pp
.Fn AG_SwapLE16 ,
.Fn AG_SwapLE32
and
.Fn AG_SwapLE64
returns the given value with the byte order reversed if the current
architecture is big-endian.
On little-endian machines, these functions return the value unchanged.
.Pp
.Fn AG_SwapBE16 ,
.Fn AG_SwapBE32
and
.Fn AG_SwapBE64
returns the given value with the byte order reversed if the current
architecture is little-endian.
On big-endian machines, these functions return the value unchanged.
.Pp
If 64-bit types are not supported,
.Fn AG_Swap64 ,
.Fn AG_SwapLE64
and
.Fn AG_SwapBE64
are not defined.
