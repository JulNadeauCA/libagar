.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Cursor
.Nd agar cursor operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
#include <agar/gui/cursors.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface allows Agar widgets to change the shape of the cursor.
Since the Agar window system as well as various Agar widgets also need to
change the cursor, this interface should always be used as opposed to
platform-specific APIs or
.Xr SDL_SetCursor 3
in SDL mode.
.Pp
The following built-in cursors are currently defined:
.Bd -literal
enum {
	AG_FILL_CURSOR,
	AG_ERASE_CURSOR,
	AG_PICK_CURSOR,
	AG_HRESIZE_CURSOR,
	AG_VRESIZE_CURSOR,
	AG_LRDIAG_CURSOR,
	AG_LLDIAG_CURSOR,
	AG_TEXT_CURSOR,
	AG_LAST_CURSOR
};
.Ed
.Sh INTERFACE
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_SetCursor "int CursorID"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_UnsetCursor "void"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_SetCursor
function changes to the specified cursor shape.
The change does not take effect until the end of the current event
processing loop.
.Pp
.Fn AG_UnsetCursor
changes the cursor shape back to the default.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr AG_Intro 3 ,
.Xr AG_Widget 3 ,
.Xr AG_Window 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in Agar 1.0.
