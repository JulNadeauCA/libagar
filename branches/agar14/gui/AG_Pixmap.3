.Nd agar pixmap display widget
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget displays an image in pixmap format.
It is frequently used along with
.Xr AG_Fixed 3
to display interface decorations.
.Pp
In OpenGL mode, the image surfaces are uploaded to the texture unit as
they are mapped or updated.
.Pp
Small animations can be efficiently displayed by mapping one surface per frame
and invoking
.Fn AG_PixmapSetSurface
from a timer with
.Xr AG_Timeout 3 .

The
.Fn AG_PixmapNew
function creates a new
.Nm
not linked to any surface.
The initial geometry of the widget is defined by the
.Fa width
and
.Fa height
parameters.
There are currently no
.Fa flags
specific to this widget.
.Pp
The following functions create a new
.Nm
with an image obtained from the given source.
When using these constructors, the geometry of the widget is set to
that of the source image.
.Pp
.Fn AG_PixmapFromSurface
maps an existing
.Xr SDL_Surface 3 ,
which must remain valid until the widget is destroyed.
.Fn AG_PixmapFromSurfaceCopy
creates a copy of the given
.Ft SDL_Surface
that will be freed automatically along with the widget instance.
.Fn AG_PixmapFromSurfaceScaled
uses a rescaled copy of the given surface.
.Pp
Use
.Fn AG_PixmapFromBMP
to load the image from a Windows Bitmap file, or
.Fn AG_PixmapFromXCF
to load from a Gimp XCF file.

The
.Nm
widget can map multiple surfaces and switch between them.
To add a new surface, use
.Fn AG_PixmapAddSurface ,
.Fn AG_PixmapAddSurfaceCopy
or
.Fn AG_PixmapAddSurfaceScaled .
.Pp
.Fn AG_PixmapSetSurface
changes the currently visible surface to another surface that has been
previously mapped with
.Fn AG_PixmapAddSurface* .
To replace an existing mapped surface, use
.Fn AG_PixmapReplaceSurface
or
.Fn AG_PixmapReplaceSurfaceScaled
with the name of the surface.
.Pp
If you need to modify the contents of a previously mapped surface, it is
necessary to call
.Fn AG_PixmapUpdateSurface
when you're done.
It has no effect in direct video mode, but it causes the texture to be
re-uploaded to the graphics hardware in OpenGL mode.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PixmapSetCoords
function changes the source coordinates of the active surface.
The default is [0,0].
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget neither reacts to nor generates any event.
.Sh STRUCTURE DATA
.Bl -tag -width "int s, t "
.It Ft int s, t
Source surface coordinates.
Can be set using
.Fn AG_PixmapSetCoords .

.Pp
The
.Pa demos/fixedres
demo in the Agar distribution illustrates the use of
.Xr AG_Fixed 3
and
.Nm
in a game-style interface.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
widget first appeared in Agar 1.0.
