Agar-Net - Query-oriented client/server framework
=================================================

What is it?
-----------
Agar-net is a network package that aims to faciliate the development
of client/server applications. It includes a lightweight client library
as well as an efficient, privilege-separated server framework.

How does it work?
-----------------
Using the client API, client applications will typically connect to an
agar-net server, authenticate and issue one or more queries.

The server consists of a master process that manages a set of child
processes. Those processes can either serve network client sessions or
execute concurrent server tasks. Child processes usually revoke their
privileges and then communicate with the master process over a socket
pair using a secure, well-defined protocol.

An agar-net server program defines a set of functions (or commands) which
may be invoked from a network client. Those functions accept specific
arguments and return data in a specific format. Some functions are executed
in the child process, some are executed in the master process - depending
on the application.

The agar-net server framework uses I/O multiplexing along with buffers
and non-blocking transfers such that multiple concurrent data streams
can be supported efficiently and with maximum performance.

Availability

The latest version of agar-net is available at http://agar-net.csoft.org/.

Portability
-----------

system.
