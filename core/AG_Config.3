.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Config
.Nd agar configuration interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
object records configuration settings global to an Agar application.
This includes user preferences which are to be preserved after the
application has exited.
.Pp
Library or application-specific data may also be stored in the configuration
object as
.Xr AG_Variable 3
values.
Variable names should not start with "ag_", the prefix is reserved for
internal Agar settings.
.Pp
Note that our
.Xr AG_Variable 3
system implements pointers (or "bindings"), so it is always possible for
a parameter value to be specified as a pointer to an external piece of data.

.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_ConfigObject
function returns a pointer to the global
.Nm
object.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ConfigLoad
function loads the configuration data from disk, returning 0 on sucess
or -1 on failure.
It is equivalent to calling
.Xr AG_ObjectLoad 3
on the
.Va agConfig
object.
Note that
.Fn AG_ConfigLoad
must be called after the initialization of all Agar libraries
(i.e., if an application uses Agar-GUI, then the
.Fn AG_ConfigLoad
call must follow the
.Fn AG_InitGraphics
call).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ConfigSave
function saves the configuration data to disk, returning 0 on success
or -1 on failure.
It is equivalent to calling
.Xr AG_ObjectSave 3
on the
.Va agConfig
object.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ConfigFind
function searches a list of registered paths for the given file.
.Fa group
may be
.Dv AG_CONFIG_PATH_DATA
(for object and data files), or
.Dv AG_CONFIG_PATH_FONTS
(for fonts).
If
.Fa filename
is found and and the file is accessible, then its absolute pathname is
copied into the fixed-size buffer
.Fa dst_path
(limited to
.Fa dst_len
bytes), and
.Fn AG_ConfigFind
returns 0.
If the file cannot be found, it returns -1.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ConfigAddPath
adds the specified directory to the list of
.Fn AG_ConfigFind
search paths.
.Fn AG_ConfigDelPath
removes the given directory from the list of registered search paths.
.Sh CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
The following parameters are registered by Agar-Core:
.Bl -tag -width "BOOL initial-run "
.It Va BOOL initial-run
Application is being ran for the first time (read-only).
.It Va STRING save-path
Target directory for writing the
.Xr AG_Object 3
virtual filesystem.
.It Va STRING tmp-path
Directory for temporary files.
Default is platform-dependent (on POSIX platforms, the
.Ev TMPDIR
environment variable is honored).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code sets an integer option and a string.
The configuration is then immediately saved to disk:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AG_SetInt(agConfig, "my-setting", 1);
AG_SetString(agConfig, "my-string", "Foo bar");
AG_ConfigSave();
.Ed
.Pp
The following Agar-GUI code displays a checkbox controlling the value
of "my-setting":
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AG_Checkbox *cb = AG_CheckboxNew(win, 0, "My setting");
AG_BindVariable(cb, "state", agConfig, "my-setting");
.Ed
.Pp
The following code binds "my-ext-setting" to an external variable, and then
reads the configuration from disk.
If the saved configuration has "my-ext-setting" defined, then the variable will
be set accordingly:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int myExtSetting = 0;

AG_BindInt(agConfig, "my-ext-setting", &myExtSetting);
AG_ConfigLoad();
