.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_DSO
.Nd agar portable dynamic linker interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a cross-platform interface for loading code from a dynamic library
file into the current process's address space, resolving symbols defined by
the library, and unloading the library.
.Sh INTERFACE
.nr nS 1
.Ft "AG_DSO *"
.Fn AG_LoadDSO "const char *name" "const char *path" "Uint flags"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_SymDSO "AG_DSO *dso" "const char *symbol" "void **rv"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_LockDSO "void"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_UnlockDSO "void"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_UnloadDSO "AG_DSO *dso"
.Pp
.Ft "AG_DSO *"
.Fn AG_LookupDSO "const char *name"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_LoadDSO
function loads the dynamic library file at
.Fa path
into the current process's address space.
If the library has already been loaded, the existing
.Nm
structure is returned and its reference count incremented.
.Fa name
is a string identifier for the library for use by the
.Xr AG_Object 3
system independently of the file location.
If the library was loaded successfully, a pointer to the new
.Ft AG_DSO
structure is returned.
If an error has occurred return NULL with an error message.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SymDSO
function tries to resolve the named
.Fa symbol .
If successful, the value is returned into
.Fa rv
and 0 is returned.
Otherwise, -1 is returned and an error message is set.
Under threads, the value returned into
.Fa rv
remains valid as long as
.Fn AG_LockDSO
is in effect.
.Fn AG_SymDSO
automatically prepends an underscore to the symbol if required.
.Pp
.Fn AG_LockDSO
and
.Fn AG_UnlockDSO
acquire and release the lock protecting the list of loaded libraries
and their resolved symbols.
In multithreaded applications requiring the ability to unload modules, it is
not safe to reference resolved symbols without acquiring this lock.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_UnloadDSO
function decrements the reference count of the specified
.Nm
object.
If it reaches zero, the library is removed from the process's address space.
.Pp
.Fn AG_LookupDSO
searches the list of currently loaded DSOs by the specified name.
If no match is found, NULL is returned.
.Sh STRUCTURE DATA
For the
.Fa AG_DSO
structure:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "char path[AG_PATHNAME_MAX] "
.It char name[AG_DSO_NAME_MAX]
Platform-independent name for this module.
.It char path[AG_PATHNAME_MAX]
Full path to dynamic library file.
.It TAILQ(AG_DSOSym) syms
List of previously resolved symbols
.El
.Pp
For the
.Fa AG_DSOSym
structure:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "char *sym"
.It char *sym
Symbol name
.It char *p
Resolved address
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragments loads a DSO and resolves a symbol from it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.\" SYNTAX(c)
AG_DSO *dso;
void *pMySymbol;

if ((dso = AG_LoadDSO("my_dso", 0)) == NULL) {
	AG_FatalError();
}
if (AG_SymDSO(dso, "my_symbol", &pMySymbol) == 0) {
	Verbose("Resolved \\"my_symbol\\" address: %p\\n",
	    pMySymbol);
} else {
	Verbose("Could not resolve \\"my_symbol\\"\\n");
}
AG_UnloadDSO(dso);
