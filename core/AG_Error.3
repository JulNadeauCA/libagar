.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Error
.Nd agar error handling
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the error handling system which is used by
all Agar libraries, and available to applications as well.
.Sh ERROR RETURNS
.nr nS 1
.Ft "const char *"
.Fn AG_GetError "void"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_SetError "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_FatalError "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_GetError
function returns the error message string last set by
.Fn AG_SetError .
.Pp
the
.Fn AG_SetError
function sets the error message string using a
.Xr printf 3
like format string.
.Pp
If Agar was compiled with thread support, both
.Fn AG_SetError
and
.Fn AG_GetError
use thread-specific data keys to achieve thread safety.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_FatalError
function outputs the given error message to the user and causes abnormal
termination of the program.
.Sh DEBUG ROUTINES
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_Verbose "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_Debug "AG_Object *obj" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.nr nS 0
These functions output a string to the debugging console used by the
application (usually
.Xr stdio 3 ) .
.Pp
.Fn AG_Verbose
outputs a string if the global
.Va agVerbose
variable is set.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_Debug
function outputs a string on the debugging console of
.Fa obj ,
assuming it has the
.Dv AG_OBJECT_DEBUG
flag set.
The name of the object is prefixed to the string.
.Sh ERROR WRAPPERS
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void *"
.Fn AG_Malloc "size_t len"
.Pp
.Ft "void *"
.Fn AG_Realloc "void *p" "size_t len"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_Free "void *p"
.Pp
.Ft "char *"
.Fn AG_Strdup "const char *s"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Ft AG_Malloc
function calls
.Xr malloc 3
and raises a fatal error if the memory cannot be allocated.
It is a good practice to use this wrapper only when allocating structures
and other fixed-size items.
.Pp
.Ft AG_Realloc
calls
.Xr realloc 3
and raises a fatal error if the memory cannot be allocated.
If
.Fa p
is NULL, it calls
.Xr malloc 3
instead.
.Pp
.Ft AG_Free
calls
.Xr free 3 .
If
.Fa p
is NULL, it is a no-op.
.Pp
.Fn AG_Strdup
duplicates a string
.Fa s
and raises a fatal error if memory cannot be allocated for the duplicate.

interface first appeared in Agar 1.0
