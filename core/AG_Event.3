.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Event
.Nd agar event handlers / virtual functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
(or
.Ft AG_Function )
type represents an event handler (or more generally a virtual function)
under an
.Xr AG_Object 3 .
It is the basis of Agar message passing.
Event handlers are tagged with a case-insensitive string up to
.Dv AG_EVENT_NAME_MAX
bytes in size.
Anonymous functions are denoted by an empty tag.
Functions are declared as follows:
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.\" NOMANLINK
.Ft void
.Fn MyEventHandler "AG_Event *event"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Pp
An
.Ft AG_Event
may store up to
.Dv AG_EVENT_ARGS_MAX
arguments.
The arguments contained in an
.Ft AG_Event
can be accessed both by
.Em index
and by
.Em name
(names are case-insensitive strings up to
.Dv AG_VARIABLE_NAME_MAX
bytes).
The argument stack contains the arguments from the initial
.Fn AG_SetEvent
call first, followed by additional arguments tacked on by any subsequent
.Fn AG_PostEvent
calls (see
.Sx EVENT ARGUMENTS
for more details and examples).
.Pp
Agar objects can act as event senders or event receivers.
Execution of event handlers can be delayed for a set amount of time, or marked
for execution in a separate thread.
.Nm
provides a thread-safe message passing system for multithreaded applications.

.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_SetEvent
function registers a new event handler to service events of type
.Fa name .
If an event handler is already registered for the given event type, it
is replaced.
The
.Fn AG_AddEvent
variant preserves any existing event handler, such that multiple handlers
can be invoked when the event is raised.
The
.Fa fn
argument is a pointer to the event handler function, and
.Fa fnArgs
is a special kind of format string specifying a list of arguments (see
.Sx EVENT ARGUMENTS
section).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_FindEventHandler
function searches for an event handler by name, returning a pointer to the
.Nm
element on success or NULL if there is no match.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_UnsetEvent
function deletes the named event handler.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PostEvent
function immediately executes the event handler function associated with the
given event type, if there is any.
The
.Fa fn
and
.Fa fnArgs
arguments to
.Fn AG_PostEvent
are interpreted in the same way as
.Fn AG_SetEvent
and
.Fn AG_AddEvent ,
but the arguments are appended at the end of the argument list.
When the event handler function retrieves arguments by index (as opposed to
using argument names), it is important to remember that the arguments to
.Fn AG_PostEvent
follow the arguments given to
.Fn AG_SetEvent
or
.Fn AG_AddEvent .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PostEvent
function returns 1 if an event handler was invoked, or 0 if there is no
registered event handler for the specified event.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PostEventByPtr
variant accepts a pointer to an
.Nm
element, as opposed to looking up the event handler by name.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
function provides an interface similar to
.Fn AG_PostEvent ,
except that the event is scheduled to occur in the given number of ticks
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
returns 0 on success or -1 if the timer could not be created.
If the object is detached or destroyed, all events scheduled for execution
are automatically cancelled.
A more flexible interface for implementing timers is described in
.Xr AG_Timer 3
(which
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
uses internally).
.Sh EVENT ARGUMENTS
The
.Fn AG_SetEvent ,
.Fn AG_AddEvent
and
.Fn AG_PostEvent
routines accept a special
.Fa fnArgs
format string specifying a list of arguments to be passed to the event handler
function.
For example, the
.Sq %s,%p,%i
string specifies that the following arguments are a string, a pointer and an
.Ft int .
The arguments would retrieved by the event handler function like so:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
MyEventHandler(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *s = AG_STRING(1);
	void *p = AG_PTR(2);
	int i   = AG_INT(3);
}
.Ed
.Pp
Named arguments are also supported.
For example, the format string
.Sq %s(foo),%p(bar),%i(baz)
specifies string, pointer and integer arguments, which can be retrieved using:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
MyEventHandler(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *s = AG_STRING_NAMED("foo");
	void *p = AG_PTR_NAMED("bar");
	int i   = AG_INT_NAMED("baz");
}
.Ed
.Pp
The following argument specifiers are accepted:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "%li "
.It "%p"
Generic pointer:
.Ft "void *" .
.It "%i"
Signed integer:
.Ft int .
.It "%u"
Unsigned integer:
.Ft Uint .
.It "%li"
Signed long integer:
.Ft long .
Not in
.Dv AG_SMALL .
.It "%lu"
Unsigned long integer:
.Ft Ulong .
Not in
.Dv AG_SMALL .
.It "%f"
Real number:
.Ft float .
Requires
.Dv AG_HAVE_FLOAT .
.It "%d"
Real number:
.Ft double .
Requires
.Dv AG_HAVE_FLOAT .
.It "%s"
C string (NUL-terminated):
.Ft "char *" .
.El
.Pp
The following macros extract the arguments contained in an
.Nm
structure.
If Agar is compiled with either --enable-debug or --enable-type-safety,
they also check for potential accesses to incorrect types.

.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_SELF
macro (equivalent to AG_PTR(0)) returns a pointer to the
.Xr AG_Object 3
receiving the event (the
.Fa rcvr
argument to
.Fn AG_PostEvent ) .
.Fn AG_SENDER
returns a pointer to the object sending the event (the
.Fa sndr
argument to
.Fn AG_PostEvent ) ,
if there is one.
.Pp
The following macros return a specific item in the list of arguments.
When retrieving arguments by index, note that the arguments to
.Fn AG_PostEvent
follow the arguments to
.Fn AG_SetEvent
(i.e., the arguments to
.Fn AG_SetEvent
are pushed first onto the argument stack, followed by the arguments to
.Fn AG_PostEvent ,
if any).
These macros ensure type safety if Agar is compiled with either
--enable-debug or --enable-type-safety.
.Pp
.Fn AG_PTR
returns a pointer, previously passed as a
.Sq %p
argument.
.Pp
.Fn AG_OBJECT
returns a pointer to an
.Xr AG_Object 3
(previously passed as a
.Sq %p
argument).
It differs from
.Fn AG_PTR
in that the object pointer is verified against the specified object class
and a fatal error is raised if runtime type checking is in effect.
.Pp
.Fn AG_STRING
returns a pointer to a string, previously passed as a
.Sq %s
argument.
The event handler is not allowed to modify the string.
.Pp
.Fn AG_INT ,
.Fn AG_UINT ,
.Fn AG_LONG
and
.Fn AG_ULONG
return the specified native integral number, previously passed as a
.Sq %i ,
.Sq %u ,
.Sq %li
or
.Sq %lu
argument respectively.
.Pp
.Fn AG_FLOAT
and
.Fn AG_DOUBLE
return the given floating-point number, previously passed as a real
.Sq %f
or
.Sq %d
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_*_NAMED
macros retrieve the given argument by name instead of by index.
If there is no argument matching the name, a fatal error is raised.
.Sh ARGUMENT MANIPULATION
In some cases it is desirable for functions to accept a list of event handler
arguments like
.Fn AG_SetEvent ,
and possibly manipulate its entries directly.
For example, the
.Xr AG_MenuAction 3
function of the GUI widget
.Xr AG_Menu 3
accepts a pointer to an event handler function, followed by an
.Fn AG_SetEvent
style format string and a variable list of arguments.
The following functions allow such manipulations.
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventInit "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventArgs "AG_Event *ev" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventCopy "AG_Event *dst" "const AG_Event *src"
.Pp
.Ft "AG_Event *"
.Fn AG_EventDup "const AG_Event *src"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushPointer "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "void *val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushString "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "char *val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushInt "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "int val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushUint "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "Uint val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushLong "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "long val"
.Pp

.Fn AG_EventPushUlong "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "Ulong val"
.Pp

.Fn AG_EventPushFloat "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "float val"
.Pp

.Fn AG_EventPushDouble "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "double val"
.Pp

.Fn AG_EVENT_PUSH_ARG "va_list ap" "char formatChar" "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp

.Fn AG_EventPopPointer "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp

.Fn AG_EventPopString "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp

.Fn AG_EventPopInt "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp

.Fn AG_EventPopUint "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.Ft "long"
.Fn AG_EventPopLong "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.Ft "Ulong"
.Fn AG_EventPopUlong "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.Ft "float"
.Fn AG_EventPopFloat "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.Ft "double"
.Fn AG_EventPopDouble "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_EventInit
routine initializes an
.Ft AG_Event
structure with no arguments.
.Pp
.Fn AG_EventArgs
initializes
.Fa ev
and also specifies a list of arguments (in the same format as
.Fn AG_SetEvent ) .
.Pp
.Fn AG_EventCopy
copies the function pointer and arguments from one
.Nm
to another.
.Fn AG_EventDup
returns a newly-allocated duplicate.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_EventPush*
functions append an argument to the end of the argument list for the specified
.Nm
structure.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_EVENT_PUSH_ARG
macro also insert an argument, except that the type is obtained from
.Fa formatChar ,
assumed to be a character from an
.Fn AG_SetEvent
style format string, and the argument is retrieved using
.Xr va_arg 3 .
.Sh EVENT QUEUES
Under some circumstances, it is useful to gather
.Ft AG_Event
objects into a simple queue.
For example, a custom event loop routine (see
.Xr AG_EventLoop 3 )
or a low-level Agar driver (see
.Xr AG_Driver 3 )
may gather events from input devices and later process them.
.Sh STRUCTURE DATA
For the
.Ft AG_Event
structure:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "AG_Variable *argv "
.It Ft char * name
String identifier for the event.
.It Ft Uint flags
See
.Sx EVENT FLAGS
section below.
.It Ft int argc
Argument count.
.It Ft AG_Variable *argv
Argument data (see
.Xr AG_Variable 3 ) .
.El
.Sh EVENT FLAGS
Acceptable
.Va flags
for the
.Nm
structure include:
.Bl -tag -width "AG_EVENT_PROPAGATE "
.It AG_EVENT_ASYNC
Arrange for the event handler to execute inside a separate thread that will
be automatically created (and managed by the receiver object).
This flag is only available if Agar was compiled with the
.Dv AG_THREADS
option.
.It AG_EVENT_PROPAGATE
Automatically forward events of this type to all attached child objects.
If
.Dv AG_EVENT_ASYNC
is also set, the event handlers of the child objects are executed concurrently.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment demonstrates a typical
.Nm
usage in the Agar-GUI library.
We bind an action to the button press event, which is called
.Sq button-pushed .
This event is documented in the
.Xr AG_Button 3
manual, and so are the arguments it appends to the list of arguments passed
to the event handler (in this case, a single
.Ft int ) .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
SayHello(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *s   = AG_STRING(1);  /* From AG_SetEvent() */
	int state = AG_INT(2);     /* From later AG_PostEvent() */

	AG_TextMsg(AG_MSG_INFO, "Hello, %s! (state=%d)", s, state);
}

AG_Button *btn;

btn = AG_ButtonNew(NULL, 0, "Say hello");
AG_SetEvent(btn, "button-pushed", SayHello, "%s", "World");
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ft AG_Button
API provides a shorthand constructor routine,
.Fn AG_ButtonNewFn ,
which accepts the
.Sq button-pushed
event handler as argument:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AG_ButtonNewFn(NULL, 0, "Say hello", SayHello, "%s", "World");
.Ed
.Pp
The following code fragment is equivalent:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AG_Button *btn;
AG_Event *ev;

btn = AG_ButtonNew(NULL, 0, "Say hello");
ev = AG_SetEvent(btn, "button-pushed", SayHello, NULL);
AG_EventPushString(ev, NULL, "World");
.Ed
.Pp
The following code fragment invokes a handler routine artificially:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
SayHello(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *s = AG_STRING(1);
	int   i = AG_INT(2);
}

AG_Event ev;

AG_EventArgs(&ev, "%s,%d", "Foo string", 1234);
SayHello(&ev);
