.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm event
.Nd agar event system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/event.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
system can post events to agar
.Xr object 3
structures and derivates.
.Sh EVENT HANDLERS
Event handlers are identified by null-terminated strings.
Event handler arguments are described by an array of unions:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
typedef union evarg {
	void	*p;
	char	*s;
	char	 c;
	int	 i;
	long int li;
	double	 f;
} *evargs;

.Sh EVENT PROCESSING
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn event_new "void *obj" "char *event" "void (*handler)(int argc, union evarg *argv)" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn event_post "void *obj" "char *event" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn event_forward "void *obj" "char *event" "int argc" "union evarg *argv"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn event_new
function registers a new event handler for an event identified by the
null-terminated
.Fa event
string.
.Fa obj
will be passed as the first argument to the event handler function.
.Fa handler
points to the event-handling function.
The
.Fa fmt
argument is a
.Xr printf 3
style format string.
The following arguments will be inserted at the start of the evarg
array.
.Pp
The
.Fn event_post
function invokes the event handler matching the event identified by the
null-terminated
.Fa event
string, if any.
The
.Fa fmt
argument is a
.Xr printf 3
like format string.
The following arguments will be inserted at the end of the evarg
array.
.Pp
The
.Fn event_forward
function forwards the event identified by
.Fa event
to object
.Fa obj .
.Fn event_forward
is usually called from an event handler.

The
.Nm
layer first appeared in AGAR 1.0
