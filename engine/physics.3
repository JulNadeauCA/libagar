.Sh NAME
.Nm physics
.Nd agar movement interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/physics.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
interface manages movement of object positions in reaction to input device
events.
The direction of the object is determined by the following bits:
.Bd -literal
#define DIR_N	0x01
#define DIR_S	0x02
#define DIR_W	0x04
#define DIR_E	0x08
#define DIR_NW	(DIR_N|DIR_W)
#define DIR_NE	(DIR_N|DIR_E)
#define DIR_SW	(DIR_S|DIR_W)
#define DIR_SE	(DIR_S|DIR_E)
.Ed
.Sh MAP DIRECTIONS
This interface implements movement of unique object positions between adjacent
map nodes.
Game objects are bound to an input device with
.Fn object_set_input
and the
.Xr input 3
subsystem calls
.Fn mapdir_set
and
.Fn mapdir_unset
in reaction to input device events.
The
.Fn mapdir_move
function is invoked periodically (from a timer callback function, for instance),
in order to update the position.

                    "int moved"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn mapdir_init
function initializes a map direction for object
.Fa ob
on map
.Fa map .
The
.Fa flags
may contain:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define DIR_CENTER_VIEW  0x01	/* Center view around object and scroll. */
#define DIR_SOFT_MOTION  0x02	/* Animate node->node displacements. */
#define DIR_PASS_THROUGH 0x04	/* Ignore node surface settings. */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn mapdir_set
function sets the direction of
.Fa dir
to
.Fa direction .
The
.Fn mapdir_unset
requests
.Fa dir
to no longer move in
.Fa direction .
.Pp
The
.Fn mapdir_move
function is usually called from a timer callback to update the direction
.Fa dir ,
returning the direction towards which the object should move, or 0 if it
should remain in its current position.
The
.Fa map_x
and
.Fa map_y
arguments should point to the current coordinates of the object on the map,
and will be updated accordingly.
.Pp
If the timer callback has moved the map reference, it should call
.Fn mapdir_postmove
with the return value of
.Fn mapdir_move
as the
.Fa moved
argument, to effect a
.Fn mapdir_unset
operation, increment the necessary counters or ensure the object keeps
moving.
The
.Fa map_x
and
.Fa map_y
arguments are the same pointers that were passed to
.Fn mapdir_move .
