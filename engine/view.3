.Sh NAME
.Nm view
.Nd agar graphic management interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/view.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar
.Nm
layer manages the video display.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn view_init "enum gfx_engine engine"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_destroy "void"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn view_set_refresh "int fps"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn view_init
function initializes the graphic engine, returning 0 on success and -1 on
failure.
If the
.Sq view.opengl
property is set,
.Fn view_init
will attempt to create an OpenGL rendering context.
The
.Fa engine
argument is one of:
.Bd -literal
enum gfx_engine {
	GFX_ENGINE_GUI,         /* Direct/OpenGL, GUI */
	GFX_ENGINE_TILEBASED    /* Direct/OpenGL, tile-based */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn view_destroy 
function frees resources allocated by the view structure.
.Pp
The
.Fn view_set_refresh
function sets the nominal refresh rate, given in frames per second.
.Sh GRAPHIC SURFACES
.nr nS 1
.Ft "SDL_Surface *"
.Fn view_copy_surface "SDL_Surface *src"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_scale_surface "SDL_Surface *src" "Uint16 width" "Uint16 height" "SDL_Surface **dst"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn view_same_pixel_fmt "SDL_Surface *s1" "SDL_Surface *s2"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_pixels_alpha "SDL_Surface *surface" "Uint8 alpha"
.Pp
.Ft "GLuint"
.Fn view_surface_texture "SDL_Surface *src" "GLfloat *texcoord"
.Pp

.Fn view_update "int x" "int y" "int w" "int h"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_capture "SDL_Surface *su"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
These functions operate on
.Xr SDL_Surface 3
structures.
.Pp
The
.Fn view_copy_surface
returns a newly allocated surface containing a copy of
.Fa src .
.Pp
The
.Fn view_scale_surface
functions performs pixmap scaling of surface
.Fa src
to
.Fa width
by
.Fa height
pixels.
If
.Fa dst
is NULL, a new surface is allocated.
.Pp
The
.Fn view_same_pixel_fmt
function returns 1 if the surfaces
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
share the same depth, RGBA masks and colorkey.
.Pp
The
.Fn view_pixels_alpha
function changes the alpha value of all pixels except those with an
alpha channel of 0, to
.Fa alpha .
.Pp
If OpenGL support is available,
.Fn view_surface_texture
creates an OpenGL texture from
.Fa src
.Pp
The
.Fn view_update
function queues the update of a video region.
With direct video rendering mode, this adds a
.Ft SDL_Rect
to an array that will be passed to
.Xr SDL_UpdateRects 3 .
With the OpenGL rendering mode, the entire display is queued for update.
.Fa rd
to the dirty rectangle array the event loop will pass to
.Xr SDL_UpdateRects 3
when the display is refreshed.
.Fn VIEW_UPDATE
is a no-op if OpenGL is enabled.
.Pp
The
.Fn view_capture
function encode a JPEG image file from the contents of a surface.

.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn BLEND_RGBA2_CLIPPED "SDL_Surface *s" "int x" "int y" "Uint8 r" "Uint8 g" "Uint8 b" "Uint8 alpha"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn VIEW_PUT_PIXEL "Uint8 *p" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2 "int x" "int y" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED "int x" "int y" "Uint32 c"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The macros
.Fn CLIPPED_PIXEL
and
.Fn UNCLIPPED_PIXEL
evaluate whether the pixel at the given coordinates resides inside or outside
of the clipping rectangle of the given surface.
.Pp
.Fn GET_PIXEL
returns a 32-bit interpretation of the pixel at the given location
.Fa p
in the pixel data of the surface
.Fa s .
The
.Fn GET_PIXEL2
variant finds the location of the pixel in the surface from the coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y .
.Pp
.Fn PUT_PIXEL
and
.Fn PUT_PIXEL2
write the color
.Fa c
to the pixel at the given location, without doing any clipping.
The
.Fn PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED
variant ensures that the pixel is inside the clipping rectangle of the surface
before writing to it.
.Pp
The
.Fa BLEND_RGBA ,
.Fa BLEND_RGBA2
and
.Fa BLEND_RGBA2_CLIPPED
macros operate in a manner similar to
.Fa PUT_PIXEL* ,
except that the destination pixel is alpha-blended with the color described
by the given RGB triplet, whose weight is defined by the
.Fa alpha
parameter.
.Pp
The macros
.Fn VIEW_PUT_PIXEL ,
.Fn VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2
and
.Fn VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED
behave in a manner similar to
.Fn PUT_PIXEL* ,
except that they are optimized for the display surface.
For instance, support for specific display depths may have been disabled
at compile-time.
.Sh WINDOW SYSTEM
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_attach "struct window *child"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_detach "struct window *child"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn view_detach_queued "void"
.Pp
.Ft "struct window *"
.Fn view_window_exists "char *name"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn view_attach
function attaches the window pointed to by
.Fa child
to the view.
The
.Fn view_detach
function detaches the window pointed to by
.Fa child
from the view by adding it to the detach queue.
The detachment will be performed later by
.Fa view_detach_queued .
.Pp
The
.Fn view_window_exists
functions looks for a window identified by
.Fa name
and return NULL if there is no such window.
