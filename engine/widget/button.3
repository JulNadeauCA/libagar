.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/widget/button.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget implements a simple push-button containing a string of text or
an image.

.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ButtonNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
widget.
The
.Fn AG_ButtonInit
function initializes a
.Nm
widget displaying
.Fa caption ,
unless it is NULL.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ButtonEnable
and
.Fn AG_ButtonDisable
functions trigger the sensitivity of the
.Nm
widget.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ButtonSetPadding
function sets the padding around the label in pixels.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ButtonSetFocusable
function with an argument of 0 prevents the button from gaining focus.
The default is to allow buttons to gain focus.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ButtonSetSticky
function with an argument of 1 arranges for the button to trigger its state
only on reception of
.Fn window-mousebuttondown
events.
By default,
.Fn window-mousebuttonup
events reset the state to 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ButtonSetJustification
function controls the label justification setting:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
enum ag_button_justify {
	AG_BUTTON_LEFT,
	AG_BUTTON_CENTER,
	AG_BUTTON_RIGHT
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ButtonSetSurface
and
.Fn AG_ButtonPrintf
functions are used to modify the button label.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ButtonSetRepeatMode
flag enables or disables repeat mode.
Repeat mode causes multiple
.Sq button-pushed
events to be posted periodically for as long as the button is triggered.
Repeat mode is useful for things like
.Xr spinbutton 3 .
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget reacts to the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 25n
.It window-mousebuttonup
Release the button if the cursor is inside the widget area.
.It window-mousebuttondown
Press the button.
.It window-keyup
Release the button, unless sticky mode is in effect.
.It window-keydown
Press the button.
.It window-mousemotion
Abort a button press if the cursor is moving outside the button area and sticky
mode is not in effect.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
widget generates the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 2n
.It Fn button-pushed "int new_state"
The button was pressed.
The
.Fa new_state
argument is useful in conjunction with the
.Dv AG_BUTTON_STICKY
flag.
.It Fn button-mouseoverlap "int overlap"
The mouse cursor has entered/exited the button area.
This is typically is used to display tool tips.
.El
.Sh BINDINGS
The
.Nm
widget provides the following bindings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "int *state"
.It Va int *state
Button state (1=pressed, 0=released)
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment creates a button and sets a handler function
for the
.Sq button-pushed
event:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
hello(int argc, union evarg *argv)
{
	char *s = argv[1].s;

	AG_TextMsg(AG_MSG_INFO, "Hello, %s!", s);
}
 
.Li ...

AG_Button *btn;

btn = AG_ButtonNew(parent, "Hello");
AG_SetEvent(btn, "button-pushed", hello, "%s", "world");
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr agar 3 ,
.Xr widget 3 ,
.Xr window 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
widget first appeared in Agar 1.0.
.Sh BUGS

.Fn AG_ButtonEnable
and
.Fn AG_ButtonDisable .
