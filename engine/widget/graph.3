.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget implements a resizable/scrollable graph display that can plot
different values on a dynamic range.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct graph *"
.Fn graph_new "struct region *reg" "const char *caption" "enum graph_type type" "Uint32 flags" "Sint32 yrange" "int rw" "int rh"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn graph_init "struct graph *graph" "const char *caption" "enum graph_type type" "Uint32 flags" "Sint32 yrange" "int rw" "int rh"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn graph_new
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
widget.
The
.Fn graph_init
function initializes a
.Nm
widget of size
.Fa rw
x
.Fa rh .
The
.Fa caption
argument is a null-terminated description string.
The
.Fa type
argument defines the type of graph, which is one of:
.Bd -literal
enum graph_type {
	GRAPH_POINTS,		/* Dots */
	GRAPH_LINES		/* Lines */
} type;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa yrange
argument is the value range and may be negative.
.Fa flags
can be changed at runtime, and may include:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define BUTTON_PRESSED	0x01		/* Button is pressed */
#define BUTTON_STICKY	0x02		/* Button state is static */
.Ed
.Sh PLOTTING
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct graph_item *"
.Fn graph_add_item "struct graph *graph" "char *name" "Uint32 color"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn graph_plot "struct graph_item *item" "Sint32 val"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn graph_load "struct graph_item *item" "int fd"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn graph_save "struct graph_item *item" "int fd"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn graph_add_item
function creates an item identified by the null-terminated string pointed to
by
.Fa name .
.Pp
The
.Fn graph_plot
function adds a value
.Fa val
to the graph item
.Fa item .
The
.Fn graph_load
function loads graph data from file descriptor
.Fn fd .
.Pp
The
.Fn graph_save
function saves graph data to file descriptor
.Fn fd .
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget reacts to the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 25n -indent
.It window-mousemotion
Scroll (x motion) or change the origin position (y motion).
