.Sh NAME
.Nm window
.Nd agar window structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/widget/widget.h>
#include <engine/widget/window.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
structure implements a mobile, resizable windows containing
.Xr region 3
structures, which in turn contain
.Xr widget 3
structures.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct window *"
.Fn window_new "char *caption" "int flags" "int x" "int y" "int defw" \
               "int defh" "int minwidth, int minheight"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_init "struct window *win" "int flags" "int x" "int y" "int defw" \
                "int defh" "int minwidth" "int minheight"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_destroy "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_titlebar_printf "struct window *win" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_attach "struct window *parent" "struct region *child"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_detach "struct window *parent" "struct region *child"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_new
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
structure.
The
.Fn window_new
function must not be called when the view is locked by the caller thread.
The
.Fn window_init
function initializes a
.Nm
structure.
.Pp
The
.Fn window_destroy
function frees resources allocated by a window, assuming it is no longer
attached to a view.
.Pp
The
.Fa caption
argument is a pointer to a null-terminated string that will be
displayed in the title bar (which can be changed at runtime using the
.Fn window_titlebar_printf
function).
The
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
arguments define the initial absolute position of the window, and are
ignored with the
.Dv WINDOW_CENTER
flag.
The
.Fa defw
and
.Fa defh
arguments define the default window geometry in pixels (or in percentiles
of the total view size with the
.Dv WINDOW_SCALE
flag).
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
can be changed at runtime, and may include:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define WINDOW_PLAIN		0x01	/* Solid, no borders */
#define WINDOW_ANIMATE		0x04	/* Redraw each tick */
#define WINDOW_TITLEBAR		0x08	/* Draw title bar */
#define WINDOW_ROUNDEDGES	0x10	/* Round edges */
#define WINDOW_SCALE		0x20	/* Scale regions/widgets */
#define WINDOW_SHOWN		0x40	/* Visible */
#define WINDOW_CENTER		0x80	/* Center window */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn window_attach
function attaches the region
.Fa region
to the window
.Fa parent .
The
.Fn window_detach
function detaches the region
.Fa region
from the window
.Fa parent .
The parent window must be locked when
.Fn window_attach
or
.Fn window_detach
is called.
.Pp
The
.Fn window_titlebar_printf
function sets the text shown inside the window titlebar.
The window structure must be locked when
.Fn window_titlebar_printf
is called.
.Sh VISIBILITY
.nr nS 1
.Ft int
.Fn window_show "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn window_show_locked "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn window_hide "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn window_hide_locked "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_resize "struct window *win"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_show
and
.Fn window_show_locked
functions display a window.
The
.Fn window_hide
and
.Fn window_hide_locked
functions hide a window.
.Pp
The window structure must not be locked by the caller thread when
.Fn window_show
or
.Fn window_hide
is called.
The window structure must be locked when
.Fn window_show_locked
or
.Fn window_hide_locked
is called.
.Pp
Those functions return non-zero if the window was previously visible.
.Pp
The
.Fn window_resize
function effects a change in window geometry by updating the regions
and widgets inside the window
.Fa win .
The window structure
.Fa win
must be locked when
.Fn window_resize
is called.
.Sh RENDERING
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn window_draw "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_animate "struct window *win"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_draw
function renders the window
.Fa win .
The
.Fn window_animate
function renders the animations inside the window
.Fa win .
The window structure
.Fa win
must be locked when
.Fn window_draw
or
.Fn window_animate
is called.
.Sh EVENT DISPATCHING
.nr nS 1
.Ft int
.Fn window_event_all "SDL_Event *ev"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_event_all
function translates the
.Xr SDL_Event 3
pointed to by the
.Fa ev
argument and dispatches appropriate events to relevant widgets.
The view structure must be locked, and the window list must not be
empty when
.Fn window_event_all
is called.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
object reacts directly to events of type
.Xr SDL_Event 3 ,
translates, and dispatches them to relevant
.Xr widget 3
structures.
.Pp
The
.Nm
object delivers the following events to
.Xr widget 3
objects:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Fn window-gainfocus "void"
Window gained focus.
.It Fn window-lostfocus "void"
Window no longer focused.
.It Fn window-mouseout "void"
The widget has the
.Dv WIDGET_MOUSEOUT
flag set and the mouse has moved outside of the widget area.
.It Fn window-mousemotion "int x" "int y" "int xrel" "int yrel"
The mouse cursor has moved to widget-relative coordinates
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
inside the widget area, and the widget currently holds the focus.
The
.Fa xrel
and
.Fa yrel
arguments represent the displacement relative to the last position of the
mouse cursor.
.It Fn window-mousebuttonup "int button" "int x" "int y"
The mouse button indexed by
.Fa button
was released at widget-relative
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
coordinates.
.It Fn window-mousebuttondown "int button" "int x" "int y"
The mouse button indexed by
.Fa button
was pressed at widget-relative
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
coordinates.
.It Fn window-keyup "int keysym" "int keymod"
The key identified by
.Fa keysym
was released, and the widget holds the focus.
.It Fn window-keydown "int keysym" "int keymod"
The key identified by
.Fa keysym
was pressed, and the widget holds the focus.

.Nm
system first appeared in AGAR 1.0.
