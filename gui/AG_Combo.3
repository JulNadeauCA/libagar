.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" IMAGE(http://libagar.org/widgets/AG_ComboExpanded.png, "Expanded AG_Combo(3) widget")
.\" IMAGE(http://libagar.org/widgets/AG_Combo.png, "Collapsed AG_Combo(3) widget")
The
.Nm
widget packs a
.Xr AG_Textbox 3
widget next to a
.Xr AG_Button 3
which triggers the expansion of a drop-down menu (a window containing an
.Xr AG_Tlist 3 )
when pressed.
The drop-down menu collapses if the user selects an item, or clicks outside
of the
.Nm
area.
.Pp
.Nm
provides the same functionality as
.Xr AG_UCombo 3 ,
but also adds support for text search and arbitrary text input.
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY

.Xr AG_Widget 3 ->
.Nm .
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "AG_Combo *"
.Fn AG_ComboNew "AG_Widget *parent" "Uint flags" "const char *format" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "AG_Combo *"
.Fn AG_ComboNewS "AG_Widget *parent" "Uint flags" "const char *label"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ComboSizeHint "AG_Combo *combo" "const char *text" "int nitems"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ComboSizeHintPixels "AG_Combo *combo" "int w" "int nitems"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_ComboNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a new
.Nm
widget.
The string argument specifies an optional text label to be displayed at the
left of the textbox.
Acceptable
.Fa flags
include:
.Bl -tag -width "AG_COMBO_SCROLLTOSEL "
.It AG_COMBO_POLL
List contents are dynamic (pass the
.Dv AG_TLIST_POLL
flag to the
.Va tlist ) .
.It AG_COMBO_ANY_TEXT
Allow user to enter text that does not match any item in the list.
.It AG_COMBO_SCROLLTOSEL
Scroll to initial selection if it is not visible.
.It AG_COMBO_HFILL
Expand horizontally in parent container.
.It AG_COMBO_VFILL
Expand vertically in parent container.
.It AG_COMBO_EXPAND
Shorthand for
.Dv AG_COMBO_HFILL | AG_COMBO_VFILL .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ComboSizeHint
function arranges for the
.Xr AG_Tlist 3
widget displayed on popup to request a size large enough to display the given
number of items.
The
.Fn AG_ComboSizeHintPixels
variant specifies the width in number of pixels.
.Sh ITEM SELECTION
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_ComboSelect "AG_Combo *combo" "AG_TlistItem *item"
.Pp
.Ft "AG_TlistItem *"
.Fn AG_ComboSelectPointer "AG_Combo *combo" "void *ptr"
.Pp
.Ft "AG_TlistItem *"
.Fn AG_ComboSelectText "AG_Combo *combo" "const char *text"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_ComboSelect
function sets the selection flag on the given
.Fa item .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ComboSelectPointer
function selects the first item with a user pointer value matching
.Fa ptr .
Similarly,
.Fn AG_ComboSelectText
selects the first item with a text string equal to
.Fa text .
.Pp
If the
.Dv AG_COMBO_POLL
option is set, both
.Fn AG_ComboSelectPointer
and
.Fn AG_ComboSelectText
will raise a
.Sq tlist-poll
event prior to making the selection.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget generates the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 2n
.It Fn combo-selected "AG_TlistItem *item"
An item was selected.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
widget first appeared in Agar 1.0.
As of Agar 1.6.0,
.Dv AG_COMBO_TREE
is a deprecated no-op.
"combo-expanded" and "combo-selected" appeared in Agar 1.7.0.
The
.Xr AG_Tlist 3
was formerly pre-generated and attached to the window on expand, but for
safety reasons as of Agar 1.7.0 the
.Va list
member is now initialized to NULL and the list must be generated on demand
(typically from "combo-expanded").
