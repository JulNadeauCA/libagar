.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_DriverSDL2GL
.Nd agar SDL2 OpenGL driver
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" IMAGE(http://libagar.org/widgets/AG_DriverSDL2GL.png, "The sdl2gl driver")
The Agar
.Va sdl2gl
driver provides an interface to the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library
version 2, and renders GUI elements as OpenGL primitives and managed textures.
.Pp
Using
.Xr AG_InitVideoSDL 3
as opposed to
.Xr AG_InitGraphics 3 ,
it is possible to attach Agar to an existing SDL display surface.
If the SDL surface has the
.Dv SDL_OPENGL
flag set then
.Va sdl2gl
will be auto-selected by default.
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
.Xr AG_Driver 3 ->
.Xr AG_DriverSw 3 ->
.Nm .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AG_InitGraphics("sdl2gl(width=640:height=480)");
AG_InitGraphics("sdl2gl(width=60%:height=80%)");
AG_InitGraphics("sdl2gl(bgColor=0/120/120)");
AG_InitGraphics("sdl2gl(out=%08d.jpg:outFirst=10)");
AG_InitGraphics("sdl2gl(depth=64:stereo)");

AG_InitVideoSDL(an_existing_SDL_screen, 0);

.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -compact -width "outFirst "
.It debug
Capture
.Dv GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT
errors.
.It stereo
Request a stereoscopic visual.
.It width
Width in pixels, in % of available desktop space, or "auto".
.It height
Height in pixels, in % of available desktop space, or "auto".
.It depth
Depth in bits per pixel, or "auto".
.It fpsMax
Limit GUI refresh rate in frames/second (default = 60fps).
.It out
Dump video frames to JPEG or PNG image files.
The filename path may include a printf-style (with frame number as argument).
For example,
.Sq %08d.jpg
will output frames to 00000001.jpg, 00000002.jpg, etc.
.It outFirst
Override first frame number (default = 0).
.It outLast
Terminate application after # frames have been rendered.
.It bgColor
Solid background color specified as "R/G/B", from "0/0/0" (black) to
"255/255/255" (white).
.It !bgPopup
Disable the right-click background popup menu
(which includes, notably the list of active windows).
.It jpegQual
If exporting to JPEG, set quality factor (100% = best).
.It jpegDCT
If exporting to JPEG, specify DCT method ("islow" for slow but accurate
integer method, "ifast" for fast but less accurate integer method, or
"float" for floating point method).
