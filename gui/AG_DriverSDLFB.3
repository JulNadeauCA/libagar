.Nd agar SDL1 frame-buffer driver
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" IMAGE(http://libagar.org/widgets/AG_DriverSDLFB.png, "The sdlfb driver")
The Agar
.Va sdlfb
driver provides an interface to the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library
version 1.2, and renders GUI elements directly to the frame-buffer.
Using
.Xr AG_InitVideoSDL 3
as opposed to
.Xr AG_InitGraphics 3 ,
it is possible to attach Agar to an existing SDL display surface.
