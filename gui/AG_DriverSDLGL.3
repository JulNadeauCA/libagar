.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_DriverSDLGL
.Nd agar SDL1 OpenGL driver
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" IMAGE(http://libagar.org/widgets/AG_DriverSDLGL.png, "The sdlgl driver")
The Agar
.Va sdlgl
driver provides an interface to the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library
version 1.2, and renders GUI elements as OpenGL primitives and managed textures.
.Pp
Using
.Xr AG_InitVideoSDL 3
as opposed to
.Xr AG_InitGraphics 3 ,
it is possible to attach Agar to an existing SDL display surface.
If the SDL surface has the
.Dv SDL_OPENGL
flag set, Agar selects the
.Va sdlgl
driver automatically.

.It height
Height (in pixels, in % of total desktop or "auto").
.It depth
Depth (in bits per pixel or "auto").
.It fpsMax

(which includes, notably the list of active windows).
.It jpegQual
If exporting to JPEG, set quality factor (100% = best).

.It clampOnResize
Whenever the display is resized, clamp Agar window positions and sizes
to fit the new display size.
