.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Fixed
.Nd agar pixel-precision container
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
container widgets positions its children at specific locations given in pixels.
It is useful for positioning cosmetic components applications such as games,
running at fixed resolutions.
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
.Xr AG_Object 3 ->
.Xr AG_Widget 3 ->
.Nm .
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "AG_Fixed *"
.Fn AG_FixedNew "AG_Widget *parent" "Uint flags"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_FixedNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a new
.Nm
widget.
The
.Fa flags
may include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "AG_FIXED_NO_UPDATE "
.It AG_FIXED_FILLBG
Fill the widget background with
.Dv FIXED_BG_COLOR .
.It AG_FIXED_BOX
Draw a decorative 3D-style box in the background.
.It AG_FIXED_FRAME
Draw a decorative frame in the background.
.It AG_FIXED_NO_UPDATE
Don't automatically call
.Xr WINDOW_UPDATE 3
when items are added, resized or moved.
.El
.Pp
Whenever widgets are repositioned, the Agar GUI requires a call to the
.Xr AG_WindowUpdate 3
function.
Unless the
.Dv AG_FIXED_NO_UPDATE
flag is given,
.Nm
automatically invokes this macro.
This flag is useful for manual updates after a large number of widgets are
positioned.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
is invisible.
The
.Dv AG_FIXED_FILLBG
flag causes a solid background to be drawn,
.Dv AG_FIXED_BOX
draws a 3D-style box primitive and
.Dv AG_FIXED_FRAME
draws a 2D-style frame.
.Sh CHILD WIDGETS
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_FixedPut "AG_Fixed *fixed" "void *child" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_FixedDel "AG_Fixed *fixed" "void *child"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_FixedSize "AG_Fixed *fixed" "void *child" "int width" "int height"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_FixedMove "AG_Fixed *fixed" "void *child" "int new_x" "int new_y"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_FixedPut
function attaches the widget
.Fa child
and positions it at the given coordinates.
.Fn AG_FixedDel
detaches the given widget.
.Pp
Alternatively, you can avoid
.Fn AG_FixedPut
and
.Fn AG_FixedDel
altogether and instead use
.Xr AG_ObjectAttach 3
and
.Xr AG_ObjectDetach 3
followed by calls to
.Fn AG_FixedSize
and
.Fn AG_FixedMove .
.Pp
Functions
.Fn AG_FixedSize
and
.Fn AG_FixedMove
set the size and location of a given widget in pixels.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget neither reacts to nor generates any event.
.Sh EXAMPLES
See the
.Pa fixedres
demo in the Agar
.Pa demos
directory.
