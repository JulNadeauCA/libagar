.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_GLView
.Nd low-level OpenGL context widget
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget provides a low-level OpenGL context.
.Pp
If high-level scene rendering capabilities are required, see
.Xr SG 3
and
.Xr SG_View 3 .

.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_GLViewNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a new
.Nm
widget.
There are currently no
.Fa flags
specific to this widget.
.Pp
.Fn AG_GLViewSizeHint
suggests an initial widget size in pixels.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_GLViewReshape
function recomputes the projection matrix used in the GL context and invokes
the
.Va scale
operation.
.Fn AG_GLViewReshape
is called automatically when the widget is resized.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_GLViewDrawFn
registers a the rendering function (specified in
.Xr AG_Event 3
format).
Prior to invoking this function, the widget will set the
.Xr glViewport 3
to the widget area, save the current OpenGL matrices and load the
widget-specific matrices.
.Pp
.Fn AG_GLViewOverlayFn
registers a function that will be invoked after rendering, after the
GUI matrices and viewport have been restored.
It is typically used to draw text or controls independently of the
.Nm ' s
projection and viewing matrices.
.Pp
.Fn AG_GLViewScaleFn
registers a function to invoke whenever the widget is resized.
.Pp
.Fn AG_GLViewKeydownFn ,
.Fn AG_GLViewKeyupFn ,
.Fn AG_GLViewButtondownFn ,
.Fn AG_GLViewButtonupFn
and
.Fn AG_GLViewMotionFn
register general event handler functions that will be forwarded
.Sq window-keydown ,
.Sq window-keyup ,
.Sq window-mousebuttondown ,
.Sq window-mousebuttonup
and
.Sq window-mousemotion
events, respectively.
.Sh BINDINGS
The
.Nm
widget does not provide any binding.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget reacts to the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 25n
.It widget-moved
Projection matrix is recomputed and the
.Va scale
operation is invoked.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
widget does not generate any event.

.Pa glview
demo in the Agar
.Pa demos
directory.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
widget first appeared in Agar 1.2.
