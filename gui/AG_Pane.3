.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Pane
.Nd agar paned container widget
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget is a dual container widget with a separator that is (by default)
movable by the user.
The two partitions are general-purpose
.Xr AG_Box 3
containers.
Depending on the application, partitions may or may not be allowed to shrink
to zero size.

.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_PaneNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a new
.Nm
widget.
The
.Fa type
argument is one of:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
enum ag_pane_type {
	AG_PANE_HORIZ,
	AG_PANE_VERT
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
may include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "AG_PANE_FORCE_DIV "
.It AG_PANE_DIV1FILL
Allocate the preferred size for the second division, and allocate the
remaining space to the first division (default is the other way around).
.It AG_PANE_FRAME
Render decorative frames.
.It AG_PANE_DIV
Ignore the preferred sizes and divide into two equal parts.
.It AG_PANE_FORCE_DIV
Don't allow the user to move the divider.
.El
.Pp
If
.Dv AG_PANE_FRAME
is set, the depth of the frame can be adjusted by invoking
.Xr AG_BoxSetDepth 3
on the partitions.
.Pp
By default, the two
.Xr AG_Box 3
sub-containers of
.Nm
are created automatically.
.Fn AG_PaneAttachBox
allows existing boxes to be attached and re-used.
.Fa which
must be 0 or 1.
.Fn AG_PaneAttachBoxes
is a variant that accepts two box arguments.
.Pp
.Fn AG_PaneSetDividerWidth
sets the width of the divider widget in pixels.
.Pp
By default, the user is allowed to move the separator such that one of the
two partitions can be shrunk to zero.
.Fn AG_PaneSetDivisionMin
prevents this by setting a minimal geometry in pixels for the given partition
.Fa which
(which must be either 0 or 1).
If the value -1 is given, no minimum is set.
.Pp
The separator can also be moved programmatically with the
.Fn AG_PaneMoveDivider
function.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget reacts to the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "window-mousebuttondown "
.It window-mousemotion
.It window-mousebuttonup
.It window-mousebuttondown
Move the separator, resizing the partitions.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
widget does not generate any event.
.Sh STRUCTURE DATA
.Bl -tag -width "AG_Box *div[2] "
.It Ft AG_Box *div[2]
Division containers (assuming that
.Fn AG_PaneAttachBox
was not used).
.It Ft int dmoving
Divider is currently being moved by the user (read-only).
.It Ft int dx
Actual divider position (read-only)
