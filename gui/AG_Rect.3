.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Rect
.Nd agar rectangle structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Many functions in Agar accept
.Fa AG_Rect
parameters.
This structure describes a two-dimensional integer rectangle:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct ag_rect {
	int x, y;
	int w, h;
} AG_Rect;
.Ed
.Pp
Normalized rectangles have non-negative
.Fa w
and
.Fa h .
Rectangles are serialized using signed 16-bit coordinates, and
unsigned 16-bit sizes.
.\" MANLINK(AG_Rect2)
.Pp
The
.Ft AG_Rect2
variant includes a redundant endpoint (or alternatively, a redundant size
implied by the two endpoints).
This uses more space, but allows for faster intersection tests:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct ag_rect2 {
	int x1, y1;
	int w, h;
	int x2, y2;
} AG_Rect2;

.Fn AG_RectInit
initializes an

to coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
and dimensions
.Fa w ,
.Fa h .
.Pp
.Fn AG_Rect2Init
initializes an
.Ft AG_Rect2

The
.Fn AG_ReadRect
function loads a rectangle from the given
.Xr AG_DataSource 3 .
.Fn AG_WriteRect
writes a rectangle to a data source.

.Fn AG_Rect2ToRect
convert between the
.Ft AG_Rect
and
.Ft AG_Rect2
formats.

.Fn AG_RectIntersect
and
.Fn AG_RectIntersect2
return intersection of rectangles

return 1 if the point
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
lies inside of rectangle
.Fa r .
.Pp
.Fn AG_RectCompare
and
.Fn AG_RectCompare2
return 0 if both rectangles possess the same coordinates and dimensions.
.Pp
.Fn AG_RectSize
and
.Fn AG_RectSize2
resize a rectangle to the specified dimensions.
.Pp
.Fn AG_RectTranslate
and
.Fn AG_RectTranslate2
