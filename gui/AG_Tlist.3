.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" IMAGE(/widgets/AG_Tlist.png, "An AG_Tlist displaying a tree")
The
.Nm
widget shows a scrollable tree / list of clickable and selectable items.
Items can display text and icons.
Items include user-defined data fields (a signed integer
.Va v ,
an unsigned integer
.Va u ,
a user pointer
.Va p1
and a general-purpose category string
.Va cat ) .
.Pp
For cases where the contents of the tree or list may change externally,
a
.Em polling routine
may be defined.
Such a routine is expected to clear and repopulate the list entirely.
It may be run periodically at a specified interval, whenever user interaction
events occur, or by explicit call to
.Fn AG_TlistRefresh .
To make polling more efficient (and to preserve per-item states such as
selections across polling cycles),
.Nm
relies on a
.Em compare function
to test items for equivalence and reuse assets (including allocated structures
and rendered text surfaces).

.Fn AG_TlistNew
allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
widget.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistNewPolled
variant enables
.Dv AG_TLIST_POLL
and sets the specified polling routine
.Fa eventFn
to run periodically (or -1 = never).
The polling routine is expected to clear and populate the
.Nm .
The
.Fn AG_TlistNewPolledMs
variant sets the update rate to
.Fa ms
milliseconds.
.Pp
Acceptable
.Fa flags
include:
.Bl -tag -width "AG_TLIST_FIXED_HEIGHT "
.It AG_TLIST_EXPAND_NODES
Expand nodes with child items by default.
.It AG_TLIST_MULTI
Allow multiple selections (with ctrl/shift).
.It AG_TLIST_MULTITOGGLE
Enforce multiple selections (without ctrl/shift).
.It AG_TLIST_POLL
List contents are updated dynamically by the "tlist-poll" handler.
This handler is expected to wrap its
.Fn AG_TlistAdd
calls between
.Fn AG_TlistBegin
and
.Fn AG_TlistEnd .
Implied by
.Fn AG_TlistNewPolled .
.It AG_TLIST_FIXED_HEIGHT
Don't reset the item height on "font-changed".
.It AG_TLIST_NO_KEYREPEAT
Disable keyrepeat behavior.
.It AG_TLIST_NO_SELECTED
Don't raise "tlist-selected" on select.
.It AG_TLIST_STATELESS
When using
.Dv AG_TLIST_POLL ,
don't preserve selection information across list updates.
.It AG_TLIST_HFILL
Expand horizontally in parent container.
.It AG_TLIST_VFILL
Expand vertically in parent container.
.It AG_TLIST_EXPAND
Shorthand for
.Dv AG_TLIST_HFILL | AG_TLIST_VFILL .
.El
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSetRefresh
sets the rate at which the polling routine will be invoked in milliseconds
(default = 1s).
A value of -1 disables automatic updates.
When automatic updates are disabled, updates can be performed by calling
.Fn AG_TlistRefresh .
See the
.Dv AG_TLIST_POLL
option for details.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSetItemHeight
sets the given, uniform height of all items.
.Fn AG_TlistSetIconWidth
sets the width of item icons in pixels.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSizeHint
requests sufficient height to display
.Fa nItems
items at once, and sufficient width to display an item containing
.Fa text .
The
.Fn AG_TlistSizeHintPixels
variant accepts a width argument in pixels instead of a string and the
.Fn AG_TlistSizeHintLargest
variant uses the largest text label in the current list of items to
determine the width.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSetDblClickFn
arranges for the given callback
.Fa fn
to be invoked with the given arguments (as well as the item pointer) when the
user double clicks on an item.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSetChangedFn
arranges for the callback
.Fa fn
to be invoked when the user selects or deselects an item.
The arguments are respectively, a pointer to the item and an integer with a
value of 0 to indicate deselection and 1 to indicate selection.

.Fn AG_TlistComparePtrsAndCats "const AG_TlistItem *a, const AG_TlistItem *b)
.Pp
In order for
.Nm
to be able to preserve per-item states (such as selections) through polling
updates when using a polling function, it is necessary to be able to establish
equivalence between items.
The nature of this equivalence is application-defined and is determined by the
.Em compare function
selected.
The
.Fn AG_TlistUniq
routine (see below) also relies on the compare function.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSetCompareFn
sets the comparison function to use when testing between two
.Ft AG_TlistItem
for equivalence.
It returns a pointer to the previously selected compare function.
Compare functions are defined as:
.Bd -literal
.\" SYNTAX(c)
typedef int (*AG_TlistCompareFn)(const AG_TlistItem *a,
	                         const AG_TlistItem *b);
.Ed
.Pp
It is expected to return 0 if the two items are equivalent and non-zero if
the items are not.
If the returned value if non-zero, it can be used to define the sorting
order.
Returning a positive value in the case where (a > b) should produce a sort
in descending order.
.Pp
Some basic compare functions are provided:
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistCompareInts
compares the signed integer field
.Va v1 .
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistCompareUints
compares the unsigned integer field
.Va u .
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistCompareStrings
compares the
.Va text
strings lexicographically.
The comparison is case-sensitive and ignores any locale collation.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistComparePtrs
compares the pointer fields
.Va p1 .
This is the default compare function.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistComparePtrsAndCats
compares both
.Va p1
and the category
.Va cat .

.Fn AG_TlistAdd
inserts a newly-allocated item into the list and returns a pointer to it.
If
.Fa icon
is not NULL, it specifies an
.Xr AG_Surface 3
to duplicate and display as an icon.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistAddHead
variant places the item at the head of the list.
The
.Fn AG_TlistAddPtr
variant of
.Fn AG_TlistAdd
also sets the pointer field
.Fa p1
on initialization.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistAddPtrHead
places the item at the head of the list.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistMoveToHead
moves an existing item
.Fa item
to the head of the list.
.Fn AG_TlistMoveToTail
moves an existing item
.Fa item
to the tail of the list.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSetIcon
sets the icon surface associated with
.Fa item .
A duplicate of the given surface will be used.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSetColor
sets an alternate text color for the specified item (or NULL to switch
back to the default).
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSetFont
sets an alternate font for the specified item.
If
.Fa face
is NULL, use the same font face as the tlist's font.
.Fa scale
sets the size of the font relative to the tlist's font.
If
.Fa scale
is 1.0f then the same size will be used.
The
.Fa flags
argument is the set of
.Xr AG_Font 3
style flags (such as
.Dv AG_FONT_BOLD ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistDel
function detaches and frees
.Fa item
from its parent
.Nm tl .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistSort
routine lexicographically sorts the items in the list by text
according to the current locale collation.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSortByInt
sorts items based on their integer values
.Va v .
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistUniq
scans the list for duplicates and removes them.
.Fn AG_TlistUniq
uses the compare function to determine equivalence between items
(see
.Fn AG_TlistSetCompareFn ) .
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistClear
removes all items attached to the list.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistBegin
function removes all items attached to
.Fa tl ,
but remembers their selection and child item expansion states.
.Fn AG_TlistEnd
compares each item against the saved state and restores the selection and
child item expansion states accordingly.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistVisibleChildren
function is meant to be called from a polling routine.
It tests whether a newly-created
.Fa item
should make its own child items visible based on the previously saved state.
If there are no matching items in the saved state (according to the Compare
function), then it returns the default visibility setting (which is 1 if the
.Dv AG_TLIST_EXPAND_NODES
option is set, otherwise 0).
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSelect
sets the selection flag on
.Fa item
(clearing any previous selection unless
.Dv AG_TLIST_MULTI
is set).
.Fn AG_TlistDeselect
clears the selection flag on
.Fa item .
.Fn AG_TlistSelectIdx
and
.Fn AG_TlistDeselectIdx
reference the target
.Ft AG_TlistItem
by index rather than by pointer.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistSelectAll
.Fn AG_TlistDeselectAll
sets / clears the selection on all items attached to
.Fa tl .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistSelectPtr
function selects and returns the first item with a user pointer value
matching
.Fa ptr .
Similarly,
.Fn AG_TlistSelectText
selects and returns the first item with a text field equal to
.Fa text .
Both of these functions invoke "tlist-poll" if the
.Dv AG_TLIST_POLL
option is set.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistFindByIndex
function returns the item at
.Fa index ,
or NULL if there is no such item.
The
.Fn AG_TlistSelectedItem
function returns the first selected item, or NULL if there are none.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistSelectedItemPtr
function returns the user pointer of the first selected item, or NULL if
there is no selected item.
It is not possible to distinguish a non-existent selection from an actual
selection with a NULL user pointer using this function.
.Pp
In event handler context, the
.Fn AG_TLIST_ITEM
macro is a shortcut for
.Fn AG_TlistSelectedItemPtr
on item
.Fa n
from the event stack.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistFindPtr
variant copies the user pointer associated with the first
selected item into
.Fa p ,
returning 0 on success or -1 if there is no item selected.
The
.Fn AG_TlistFindText
function searches
.Fa tl
for an item containing the
.Fa text
string and returns NULL if there is no such item.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistFirstItem
and
.Fn AG_TlistLastItem
functions return the first and last items on the list.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistScrollToStart
scrolls the display to the start and
.Fn AG_TlistScrollToEnd
scrolls the display to the end of the list.
.Pp
.Fn AG_TlistScrollToSelection
scrolls to make the first selected item visible.
It's a no-op if there are no selected items.

.Pp
.Ft "AG_MenuItem *"
.Fn AG_TlistSetPopup "AG_Tlist *tl" "const char *category"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_TlistSetPopupFn
function arranges for the given callback
.Fa fn
to be invoked with the given arguments whenever the user right-clicks on an
item on the list.
A pointer to the selected item is passed as the last argument to this function.
Typically, the function will use
.Xr AG_PopupNew 3
to display a popup menu.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TlistSetPopup
function creates a popup menu that will be displayed when the user right-clicks
on any item that matches the given category string.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget generates the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 2n
.It Fn tlist-changed "AG_TlistItem *item" "int state"
