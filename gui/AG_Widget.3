.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Widget
.Nd agar GUI base widget
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the base class for GUI widgets (and windows) in Agar GUI.
Instances of
.Nm
can be attached (using
.Xr AG_ObjectAttach 3 )
to any other
.Nm
(known as the
.Em container
widget).
General-purpose container widgets include
.Xr AG_Window 3
and
.Xr AG_Box 3 .
.Pp
The class registration interface of
.Xr AG_Object 3
allows new widgets to be implemented (or derived from existing classes).
Widgets use the object system's
.Xr AG_Event 3
to handle (and deliver) events.
.Xr AG_Variable 3
provides the basis for memory bindings (see
.Sx BINDINGS
section).
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
.Xr AG_Object 3 ->
.Nm .
.Sh CLASS OPERATIONS
Object operations specific to the
.Nm
class are defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct ag_widget_class {
	struct ag_object_class _inherit;  /* [AG_Object] -> [AG_Widget] */
	
	void (*draw)(void *obj);
	void (*size_request)(void *obj, AG_SizeReq *req);
	int  (*size_allocate)(void *obj, const AG_SizeAlloc *alloc);
} AG_WidgetClass;
.Ed
.Pp
.Fn draw
renders the widget to the graphics display (using OpenGL,
.Xr AG_WidgetPrimitives 3 ,
or other methods).
The code under
.Fn draw
is referred to as
.Em Rendering Context .
Widget primitives and functions such as
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface
are unsafe to call outside of Rendering Context.
.Pp
.Fn size_request
should return an initial, preferred geometry in pixels (without any guarantee
that the request will be satisfied).
For example, an
.Xr AG_Label 3 ,
might return the expected size of a rendered text label.
.Pp
.Fn size_allocate
is called once the widget has been successfully allocated a new size
or position within its parent (as described by the
.Va w ,
.Va h ,
.Va x
and
.Va y
members of the
.Ft AG_SizeAlloc
argument).
Container widgets allocate the position and size of their children in
.Fn size_allocate .
.Pp
.Fn size_allocate
should return 0 on success and -1 if the allocation is not satisfactory for
.Fn draw
to work at all (in which case the
.Dv UNDERSIZE
flag will be set and
.Fn draw
will not run).

.nr nS 0
.Fn AG_Expand
makes the widget fill all available space in its parent.
.Fn AG_ExpandHoriz
and
.Fn AG_ExpandVert
expands only in the given direction.
Most widget constructors also accept
.Dv EXPAND ,
.Dv HFILL
and
.Dv VFILL
options.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetSizeReq
invokes the
.Fn size_request
operation of the widget and returns its size requisition into
.Fa req .
.Fn AG_WidgetSizeAlloc
allocates the given position and geometry of the widget.
If the
.Va w
or
.Va h
argument is <= 0, the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_UNDERSIZE
flag is set, preventing the widget from subsequent rendering.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetSizeReq
and
.Fn AG_WidgetSizeAlloc
are meant to be called only from within the
.Fn size_request
and
.Fn size_allocate
functions of a container widget implementation, in order to
size and position the child widgets attached to the container
(if you must set widget geometries explicitely, use either the
.Xr AG_Fixed 3
container, or create your own container widget).
.Pp
The
.Ft AG_SizeReq
and
.Ft AG_SizeAlloc
structures are defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct ag_size_req {
	int w, h;			/* Requested geometry in pixels */
} AG_SizeReq;

typedef struct ag_size_alloc {
	int w, h;			/* Allocated geometry in pixels */
	int x, y;			/* Allocated position in pixels */
} AG_SizeAlloc;
.Ed
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetSetPosition
sets the effective position of the widget relative to its parent container.
.Fn AG_WidgetSetSize
sets the size of the widget in pixels.
.Fn AG_WidgetSetGeometry
sets both position and size of a widget from the specified
.Ft AG_Rect .
These functions are typically only used in the context of the
.Fn size_request
and
.Fn size_allocate
routines of container widgets.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetUpdate
requests an update of the computed coordinates and geometries of all widgets
attached to the widget's current window.
The widget may or may not be attached to a parent window (the actual update
will be performed later, before rendering starts in
.Fn AG_WindowDraw ) .
.Fn AG_WidgetUpdate
should be called following
.Xr AG_ObjectAttach 3
or
.Xr AG_ObjectDetach 3
calls made in event context, or manual modifications of the
.Va x ,
.Va y ,
.Va w ,
.Va h
fields of the
.Nm
structure.
.Sh STYLING
Style attributes for widgets may be defined:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
on a per-instance basis by calling
.Fn AG_SetStyle .
.It
on a per-instance basis (by "#id") in an
.Xr AG_Stylesheet 3 .
.It
on a per-class basis in an
.Xr AG_Stylesheet 3 .
.El
.Pp
Style attributes include fonts, colors and spacing (margins and padding).
.Pp
.nr nS 1

.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_SetFont "AG_Widget *obj" "const AG_Font *font"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_SetStyle
function sets the specified style attribute to the given value.
Available attributes for
.Fa attr
include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "font-family "
.It font-family
Font face specification: "Courier", "Terminal"
.It font-size
Font size: "10pts", "10.5pts", "80%" (relative to parent)
.It font-weight
Font weight: "bold", "normal" or "!parent"
.It font-style
Font style: "italic", "normal" or "!parent"
.It color
Main (or background) color for the widget.
Colors are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "Real hue/saturation/value " -compact
.It "8-bit Device RGB"
"r,g,b[,a]" or "rgb(r,g,b[,a])"
.It "16-bit Device RGB"

.It "64-bit hex"
"#rrrrggggbbbb[aaaa]"
.It "Color identifier"
"darkblue"
.It "Color string (needs CMS)"
"CIEXYZ:X/Y/Z"
.El
.Pp
Both RGB and HSV components can be expressed in "%" of the same color
in the parent widget's palette.
.It text-color
Color for rendered text (see above)
.It line-color
Color for line drawings (see above)
.It shape-color
Color for polygons and other filled shapes (see above)
.It border-color
Color for cosmetic borders (see above)
.El
.Pp
An optional selector may be appended to the attribute names:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "disabled "
.It "(none)"
Default, unfocused state.
.It "#disabled"
Widget is in disabled state (DISABLED is set).
.It "#focused"
Widget holds focus (FOCUSED is set).
.It "#hover"
Cursor is hovering over (USE_MOUSEOVER and MOUSEOVER are set).
.It "#selected"
Widget represents an active selection.
.El
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetFont
sets the widget's default font attributes to match those of the given font
(see
.Xr AG_Text 3
for details).
.Sh INPUT STATE
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_WidgetEnable "AG_Widget *obj"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_WidgetDisable "AG_Widget *obj"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_WidgetEnabled "AG_Widget *obj"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_WidgetDisabled "AG_Widget *obj"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The "enabled" flag of a widget determines whether the user is allowed to modify
whatever data the widget is accessing.
The interpretation of this flag is widget-specific.
.Fn AG_WidgetEnable
sets the flag,
.Fn AG_WidgetDisable
clears it.
These functions will raise the
.Sq widget-enabled
and
.Sq widget-disabled
events accordingly.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn AG_WidgetEnabled
and
.Fn AG_WidgetDisabled
return the current "enabled" state of the widget.
The
.Nm
object must be locked when the call is made.
.Sh FOCUS STATE
The focus state of widgets enables the reception of specific types of
events which are filtered by default.
The focus state also affects the behavior and appearance of some widgets.
A widget holding focus (in a currently focused window) will receive mouse
events
.Fn mouse-motion ,
.Fn mouse-button-up ,
as well as keyboard events
.Fn key-up
and
.Fn key-down
(note that unfocused widgets can be configured to receive those events
unfiltered as well using the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_UNFOCUSED_*
options).
.Pp

.Fn AG_WidgetForwardFocus "AG_Widget *obj" "AG_Widget *widgetToFocus"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Fn AG_WidgetSetFocusable
sets the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_FOCUSABLE
flag which allows the widget to receive focus (0 = ignore, 1 = accept focus).
Returns the previous setting.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetFocus
gives focus to the specified widget and all of its parent widgets including
the parent
.Xr AG_Window 3 .
Returns 1 on success and 0 if the widget is not accepting focus.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetUnfocus
removes the focus state from the given widget (including its child widgets,
if any).
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetIsFocused
returns 1 if the widget is currently holding focus (i.e., the widget
has the focus flag set, and its parent window, if any, is focused as
well).
.Fn AG_WidgetIsFocusedInWindow
returns 1 if the widget has the focus flag set (without evaluating the
focus state of any parent windows).
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetForwardFocus
arranges automatic forwarding of the focus to a specified widget.
Whenever
.Fa obj
gains focus, Agar will arrange for the focus to be transferred automatically to
.Fa widgetToFocus .
.Sh COORDINATES
.nr nS 1
.Ft int
.Fn AG_WidgetArea "AG_Widget *obj" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn AG_WidgetRelativeArea "AG_Widget *obj" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_WidgetArea
routine tests whether view coordinates
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
lie inside of the widget's allocated space.
The
.Fn AG_WidgetRelativeArea
variant accepts widget coordinates.
.Sh BLITTING SURFACES
These routines allow graphical surfaces to be managed (mapped in hardware or
software) and efficiently copied.
They must be called from Rendering Context (i.e., the
.Fn draw
operation of
.Nm )
only.
.Pp

.Fn AG_WidgetBlitFrom "AG_Widget *obj" "AG_Widget *srcWidget" "int surface_id" "AG_Rect *rs" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface "AG_Widget *obj" "int surface_id" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_WidgetBlit
function performs a software->hardware blit from the surface
.Fa src
to the video display at the given widget coordinates.
.Fn AG_WidgetBlit
must invoked in Rendering Context.
See
.Xr AG_Surface 3
for more information on the Agar surface structure.
.Pp
Software to hardware blits are slow, so the widget system provides an
interface to efficiently take advantage of graphics hardware where it
is available.
.Fn AG_WidgetMapSurface
registers the specified
.Xr AG_Surface 3
with the widget, returning an integer handle to that surface.
The surface can be subsequently rendered by calling
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface
or
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitFrom
using this handle.
The exact manner in which the surface is rendered depends on the Agar
driver in use.
For OpenGL-based drivers, a matching hardware texture will typically be
generated for the surface on the first call to
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface ,
and cached.
.Pp
By default, mapped surfaces are automatically freed once the widget
is destroyed.
The
.Fn AG_WidgetMapSurfaceNODUP
variant sets the "NODUP" flag on the given surface, so the widget system
will never attempt to free the surface.
.Pp
Note that
.Fn AG_WidgetMapSurface
will never duplicate the surface.
The function merely registers the provided surface pointer with the widget
structure.
The surface pointer must remain valid for the lifetime of the widget (if in
doubt, use
.Xr AG_SurfaceDup 3 ) .
.Pp
Under multithreading,
.Fn AG_WidgetMapSurface
may be invoked from any context, but the returned name is only valid as
long as the widget is locked (see
.Xr AG_ObjectLock 3 ) .
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetReplaceSurface
replaces the contents of a previously-mapped surface with the contents of
.Fa newSurface .
The
.Fn AG_WidgetReplaceSurfaceNODUP
variant avoids duplicating the surface.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetUnmapSurface
destroys the given surface mapping.
It is equivalent to invoking
.Fn AG_WidgetReplaceSurface
with a NULL surface.
The function is safe to use from any context.
.Pp
It is important to note that in OpenGL mode,
.Fn AG_WidgetReplaceSurface
and
.Fn AG_WidgetUnmapSurface
will not immediately delete any previous texture associated with the previous
surface.
Instead, it will queue the delete operation for future execution from
Rendering Context, as required by thread safety.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetUpdateSurface
function should be invoked whenever a mapped surface is changed.
If hardware surfaces are supported, it will cause an upload of the software
surface to the hardware (otherwise it is a no-op).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitFrom
function renders a previously mapped (possibly hardware) surface from the
source widget
.Fa srcWidget
(using source rectangle
.Fa rs )
onto the destination widget
.Fa obj ,
at coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y .
This function must be invoked in Rendering Context.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface
variant invokes
.Fa AG_WidgetBlitFrom
with the same argument for both
.Fa srcWidget
and
.Fa obj
(and
.Fa rs
set to NULL).
.Sh BINDINGS
Widget states can be bound to memory locations containing data in a
supported format.
For example, the "state" binding of
.Xr AG_Button 3
can be tied to an integer (or bits in an integer), such that the user pressing
the button directly manipulates the integer value in memory.
.Pp
Bindings are documented under the
.Dq BINDINGS
section of the widget's manual page.
For instance,
.Xr AG_Slider 3
mentions "value" bindings to integers.
Therefore, to control a byte of memory, one might use:
.Bd -literal
	static Uint8 myByte = 0;

	AG_Slider *slider = AG_SliderNew(window, AG_SLIDER_HORIZ, 0);
	AG_BindUint8(slider, "value", &myByte);
.Ed
.Pp
Or alternatively, using a shorthand constructor:
.Bd -literal
	AG_SliderNewUint8(window, AG_SLIDER_HORIZ, 0, &myByte, NULL, NULL);
.Ed
.Pp
This method is not limited to primitive data types.
For example,
.Xr AG_Textbox 3
can bind to a fixed-size memory buffer containing a C string in ASCII,
UTF-8 or other supported encoding.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_Bind<Type>
family of functions bind widget states to memory data.
The
.Fn AG_Bind<Type>Mp
variants accept a pointer to a mutex which will be acquired prior to accessing
the data.
The
.Fn AG_Bind<Type>Fn
variants accept a pointer to a function instead of a memory location
(the widget state will then be obtained by evaluating that function).
.Pp
Note: The
.Xr AG_Variable 3
API is actually part of
.Xr AG_Object 3 ,
and is not GUI-specific.
It can be useful in non-GUI applications as well.
.Pp
Since the state of a widget can influence its appearance
(e.g.,
.Xr AG_Button 3
is drawn as a pressed button if its "state" is 1), it may be necessary to
monitor the value and redraw when it changes.
.Fn AG_RedrawOnChange
arranges for this to occur automatically (see below).
.Sh CONTROLLING REDRAW
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_Redraw "AG_Widget *obj"
.Pp

.Fn AG_RedrawOnChange "AG_Widget *obj" "int refresh_ms" "const char *binding_name"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_RedrawOnTick "AG_Widget *obj" "int refresh_ms"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_Redraw
function signals that the widget must be redrawn to the video display.
It is equivalent to setting the
.Va dirty
variable of the widget's parent window to 1.
If called from Rendering Context,
.Fn AG_Redraw
is a no-op.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_RedrawOnChange
function arranges for the widget to be automatically redrawn whenever the
value associated with the existing binding
.Fa binding_name
changes.
The value of the binding will be checked at the specified interval
.Fa refresh_ms
in milliseconds.
If a
.Fa refresh_ms
argument of -1 is passed, the effect of any previous
.Fn AG_RedrawOnChange
call with the specified binding is disabled.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_RedrawOnTick
function arranges for the widget to be unconditionally redrawn at the
specified interval in milliseconds.
If a
.Fa refresh_ms
argument of -1 is passed, the effect of any previous
.Fn AG_RedrawOnTick
call is disabled.
.Sh WIDGET QUERIES

.Ft "AG_Widget *"
.Fn AG_WidgetFindRect "const char *className" "int x" "int y" "int w" "int h"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Fn AG_ParentWindow
returns a pointer to the parent
.Xr AG_Window 3
for the given widget instance.
The pointer is valid only as long as the parent VFS remains locked.
If the widget is not attached, NULL is returned.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetFind
locates a widget instance by name, where
.Fa path
is a
.Sq /
separated path name relative to the
.Xr AG_Driver 3
VFS root, for example: "My Window/Box #1/My button".
If the widget exists, the function returns a pointer to the
.Nm
instance.
The returned pointer is valid only as long as the parent VFS remains locked.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetFindFocused
returns the top-most focused widget under
.Fa win .
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetFindPoint
returns the top-most widget at display coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y ,
which also is an instance of a the given
.Fa className
(see
.Xr AG_ObjectClass 3 ,
.Xr AG_OfClass 3 ) .
The
.Fn AG_WidgetFindRect
variant requires that the widget enclose the whole given rectangle.
.Pp
Similarly to
.Fn AG_WidgetFind ,
the
.Nm
pointer returned by
.Fn AG_WidgetFindFocused ,
.Fn AG_WidgetFindPoint
and
.Fn AG_WidgetFindRect
should be considered valid only for as long as the parent VFS is locked.

The
.Fn AG_PushClipRect
function pushes a rectangle (in widget-relative coordinates) onto the stack of
clipping rectangles, and
.Fn AG_PopClipRect
pops the last entry from the clipping rectangle stack.
The effective clipping rectangle will be the intersection of all rectangles
on this stack.
.Fn AG_PushClipRect
and
.Fn AG_PopClipRect
must be invoked in Rendering Context.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetDraw
routine renders a widget to the display.
It is typically invoked from an event loop routine (such as
.Xr AG_EventLoop 3 ) ,
to recursively draw the hierarchy of visible GUI elements.
.Pp
In the event loop,
.Fn AG_WidgetDraw
invocations must be enclosed between calls to
.Fn AG_BeginRendering
and
.Fn AG_EndRendering .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetHide
and
.Fn AG_WidgetShow
functions toggle the visibility of the specified widget (setting the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_HIDE
flag as appropriate).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetHideAll
and
.Fn AG_WidgetShowAll
routines toggle the visibility of the specified widget and its children
by setting the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_VISIBLE
flag (which works independently of
.Dv AG_WIDGET_HIDE ) .
These routines are intended to be used by container widgets (for example,
.Xr AG_Notebook 3
which needs to show or hide tabbed containers).
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetVisible
returns 1 if the widget is currently visible (equivalent to checking the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_VISIBLE
flag).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetSurface
routine renders the widget to a newly-allocated
.Xr AG_Surface 3 .
This surface should be freed after use.
.Sh STANDARD WIDGET ACTIONS
User-generated events such as key presses or mouse button events can be
tied to
.Em actions ,
such as executing a specified routine or controlling
a boolean variable.
Registered actions are described by the
.Fa AG_Action
structure.
.Pp
Where the conditions for execution of an Action are fixed (e.g., a specific
mouse button was clicked, or a specific key was pressed), use of
.Fn AG_ActionOn*
is preferred over low-level event handlers
(such as "key-down" or "mouse-button-down"), because it allows keyboard
and mouse bindings to be configured by the end-user in a standard way.
.Xr AG_Menu 3
also provides interfaces for working with widget actions.

.nr nS 0
.Fn AG_ActionFn
registers a new widget action which is to invoke a callback function
.Fa fn ,
with arguments
.Fa fnArgs .
See
.Xr AG_Event 3
for a description of the
.Fa fnArgs
format.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ActionSetInt
registers a new action which is to set an integer
.Fa variable
to a specified
.Fa value .
Instead of an integer variable,
.Fn AG_ActionSetFlag
sets the bits specified by
.Fa bitmask
to the specified
.Fa value
(of 1 or 0).
The
.Fn AG_ActionToggleInt
and
.Fn AG_ActionToggleFlag
variants do not take an explicit
.Fa value
argument, and toggle the current value instead.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ActionOnButtonDown
and
.Fn AG_ActionOnButtonUp
tie an action to a button press and a button release event, respectively.
The
.Fa button
argument specifies the button index (see
.Xr AG_MouseButton 3 ) .
.Fn AG_ActionOnKeyDown
and
.Fn AG_ActionOnKeyUp
tie an action to a key press and key release event, respectively.
The
.Fa sym
argument specifies the key (see
.Xr AG_KeySym 3 ) ,
and
.Fa mod
specifies the modifier keys which must be in effect.
To match any key or any modifier state,
.Dv AG_KEY_ANY
or
.Dv AG_KEYMOD_ANY
can be used.
.Pp
With
.Fn AG_ActionOnKeyDown
and
.Fn AG_ActionOnKeyUp ,
the action is triggered once immediately on key press or key release.
The
.Fn AG_ActionOnKey
variant ties an action to a key press, but with "key repeat" behavior.
The action is triggered immediately once after an initial key press.
If the key combination is held longer than the "key delay" (by default 250ms),
the event is repeated with the "key repeat" interval (by default 30ms).
.Pp
If there are currently no event handlers registered for "key-up", "key-down",
"mouse-button-up" and "mouse-button-down", the
.Fn AG_ActionOn*
functions automatically register event handlers which will invoke
.Fn AG_ExecMouseAction
or
.Fn AG_ExecKeyAction
as appropriate (see below).
.Pp
.Fn AG_ExecMouseAction
executes any action associated with mouse button events.
It is typically invoked from the "mouse-button-down" and "mouse-button-up"
event handlers of the widget.
Accepted
.Fa type
values are
.Dv AG_ACTION_ON_BUTTONDOWN
and
.Dv AG_ACTION_ON_BUTTONUP .
.Fa button
is the pressed button index (see
.Xr AG_MouseButton 3 ) .
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
is the position of the cursor in the widget's coordinate system.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ExecKeyAction
executes any action associated with keyboard events.
It is typically invoked from the "key-down" and "key-up"
event handlers of the widget.
Accepted
.Fa type
values are
.Dv AG_ACTION_ON_KEYDOWN
and
.Dv AG_ACTION_ON_KEYUP .
.Fa sym
and
.Fa mod
specify the key index and modifier state (see
.Xr AG_KeySym 3
and
.Xr AG_KeyMod 3 ) .
.Pp
.Fn AG_ExecAction
executes the specified action.
.Fn AG_ExecAction
is rarely used directly, but it is invoked internally by the
.Fn AG_ExecFooAction
functions.

(these coordinates may be negative or exceed the widget's dimensions if the
cursor is not in the widget's area).
.Fa xRel
and
.Fa yRel
represent the displacement relative to the last position of the mouse cursor.
The
.Fa buttons
argument is a bitmask representing the state of mouse buttons (see
.Xr AG_MouseButton 3 ) .
.It Fn mouse-button-up "int button" "int x" "int y"
