.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Widget
.Nd agar user interface element
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the base class for user interface elements in Agar.
Widgets are organized in an ordered virtual filesystem of
.Xr AG_Object 3
elements.
The parent of a widget is referred to as its
.Em Container .
Container widgets include:
.Xr AG_Box 3 ,
.Xr AG_Fixed 3 ,
.Xr AG_Pane 3 ,
.Xr AG_Scrollview 3 ,
.Xr AG_Titlebar 3
and
.Xr AG_Window 3
itself.
.Pp
Widgets are attached to their containers with
.Xr AG_ObjectAttach 3
and detached with
.Xr AG_ObjectDetach 3 .
Unattached widgets can be freed using
.Xr AG_ObjectDestroy 3 .
Agar handles garbage collection of windows (and attached widgets) internally.
Attempting to destroy an active
.Xr AG_Window 3
or a widget which is still attached to a parent is an error
(which would trigger a fatal assertion in debug mode).
.Pp
Unless renamed with
.Xr AG_ObjectSetName 3 ,
widget instances are given a generic name (e.g., "button0").
.Xr AG_ObjectFind 3
can be used to get a pointer to a widget by pathname (e.g., "box0/button0").
.Pp
The
.Xr AG_Variable 3
table of
.Ft AG_Object
is used to store bindings data, style properties and general user data.
The
.Xr AG_Event 3
table of
.Ft AG_Object
maps widget events (such as "button-pushed") to one or more event
handlers (as registered by
.Xr AG_SetEvent 3
or
.Xr AG_AddEvent 3 ) .

typedef struct ag_widget_class {
	struct ag_object_class _inherit;

	void (*draw)(void *obj);
	void (*size_request)(void *obj, AG_SizeReq *req);

} AG_WidgetClass;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn draw
method renders the widget to the graphics display (using GL,
.Xr AG_WidgetPrimitives 3
or other methods).
The code under
.Fn draw
is referred to as
.Em rendering context .
Widget primitives and operations such as
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface
must be called only from rendering context.
.Pp
.Fn size_request
should return an initial, preferred geometry in pixels (without any guarantee
that the request will be satisfied).
For example, an
.Xr AG_Label 3 ,
might return the expected size of a rendered text label.
.Pp
.Fn size_allocate
is called once the widget has been successfully allocated a new size
or position within its parent (as described by the
.Va w ,
.Va h ,
.Va x
and
.Va y
members of the
.Ft AG_SizeAlloc
argument).
Container widgets allocate the position and size of their children in
.Fn size_allocate .
.Pp
.Fn size_allocate
should return 0 on success and -1 if the allocation is not satisfactory for
.Fn draw
to work at all (in which case the
.Dv UNDERSIZE
flag will be set and
.Fn draw
will not run).
.Pp
The
.Fn mouse_button_down
method is invoked if the user presses a button while the cursor is located
at coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
inside the widget's local coordinates system.
.Pp
The
.Fn mouse_button_up
method is invoked if the user releases a mouse button while the cursor is
located at coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
relative to the widget's local coordinates system.
The cursor must intersect the widget (or the widget hold an
.Dv AG_WIDGET_UNFOCUSED_BUTTONUP
grab).
.Pp
The
.Fn mouse_motion
method is invoked if the user moves the cursor to coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
in the widget's local coordinate system.
The widget must hold focus (or hold an
.Dv AG_WIDGET_UNFOCUSED_MOTION
grab).
The
.Fa dx
and
.Fa dy
arguments provide the displacement (in px) relative to the last mouse motion
event.
.Pp
The
.Fn key_down
and
.Fn key_up
methods are invoked whenever the user presses or releases a key on the
keyboard.
The widget must hold focus (or a
.Dv AG_WIDGET_UNFOCUSED_KEYDOWN /
.Dv AG_WIDGET_UNFOCUSED_KEYUP
grab).

flag hints to vertically-packing containers that this widget wants to fill any
remaining space along the horizontal axis.
.Dv AG_WIDGET_VFILL
flag hints to horizontally-packing containers that this widget wants to fill any
remaining space along the horizontal axis.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ExpandHoriz
and
.Fn AG_ExpandVert
functions set
.Dv AG_WIDGET_HFILL
and
.Dv AG_WIDGET_VFILL ,
respectively.
.Fn AG_Expand
is equivalent to calling both
.Fn AG_ExpandHoriz
and
.Fn AG_ExpandVert .
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetSizeReq
invokes the
.Fn size_request
operation of the widget and returns its size requisition into
.Fa req .
.Fn AG_WidgetSizeAlloc
allocates the given position and geometry of the widget.
If the
.Va w
or
.Va h
argument is <= 0, the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_UNDERSIZE
flag is set, preventing the widget from subsequent rendering.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetSizeReq
and
.Fn AG_WidgetSizeAlloc
are meant to be called only from within the
.Fn size_request
and
.Fn size_allocate
functions of a container widget implementation, in order to
size and position the child widgets attached to the container.
.Pp
The
.Ft AG_SizeReq
and
.Ft AG_SizeAlloc
structures are defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
.\" SYNTAX(c)
typedef struct ag_size_req {
	int w, h;			/* Requested geometry in pixels */
} AG_SizeReq;

typedef struct ag_size_alloc {
	int w, h;			/* Allocated geometry in pixels */
	int x, y;			/* Allocated position in pixels */
} AG_SizeAlloc;
.Ed
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetSetPosition
sets the effective position of the widget relative to its parent container.
.Fn AG_WidgetSetSize
sets the size of the widget in pixels.
.Fn AG_WidgetSetGeometry
sets both position and size of a widget from the specified
.Ft AG_Rect .
These functions are typically only used in the context of the
.Fn size_request
and
.Fn size_allocate
routines of container widgets.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetUpdate
requests an update of the computed coordinates and geometries of all widgets
attached to the widget's current window.
The widget may or may not be attached to a parent window (the actual update
will be performed later, before rendering starts in
.Fn AG_WindowDraw ) .
.Fn AG_WidgetUpdate
should be called following
.Xr AG_ObjectAttach 3
or
.Xr AG_ObjectDetach 3
calls made in event context, or external modifications to the
.Va x ,
.Va y ,
.Va w ,
.Va h
fields of the
.Nm
structure.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetUpdateCoords
is called internally to update the cached absolute display coordinates (the
.Va rView
rectangle) of
.Fa wid
and its descendents based on their current relative coordinates (the
.Va x ,
.Va y ,
.Va w ,
.Va h
members).
The widget and its parent VFS must be locked.

.Fn AG_SetStyle
sets the style attribute
.Fa attr
to the given
.Fa value .
.Pp
See
.Xr AG_StyleSheet 3
for the list of available attributes.
.Pp
The following routines are shorthand forms for
.Fn AG_SetStyle .
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetFontFamily
sets the "font-family" attribute, which can be either a font name or
the name of a file located in one of the directories in the
.Dv PATH_FONTS
of
.Xr AG_Config 3 .
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetFontSize
sets the "font-size" attribute, which may contain the suffix "%" (relative
size to the parent widget's font), the suffix "pt"
(explicit size in vector-font points) or the suffix "px"
(explicit size in bitmap-font pixels).
.Pp
Font sizes should normally be given in "%" so that the zoom function can
work as expected (Agar's zoom works simply by increasing or decreasing the
"font-size" of the target window).
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetFontWeight
sets the "font-weight" attribute, which can be one of "Thin", "ExtraLight",
"Light", "Regular" (default), "SemiBold", "Bold", "ExtraBold", "Black"
or "!parent".
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetFontStyle
sets the "font-style" attribute, which be one of "Normal" / "Regular",
"Oblique", "Italic", "UprightItalic" or "!parent".
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetFontStretch
sets the "font-stretch" attribute, which can be one of "Normal" / "Regular",
"UltraCondensed", "Condensed", "SemiCondensed", "SemiExpanded", "Expanded"
or "UltraExpanded".
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetFont
sets (inherits) font style attributes "font-family", "font-weight" and
"font-stretch" from those of the given
.Fa font .
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetMargin
sets the margin area around the widget.
The argument can be of the form "<HORIZ> <VERT>" to set horizontal and
vertical spacing in pixels, respectively.
A single argument sets both horizontal and vertical spacings to the
same value.
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetPadding
sets the padding inside the widget area.
The argument can be of the form "<TOP> <RIGHT> <BOTTOM> <LEFT>" to set
each padding in pixels.
A single argument sets all paddings to the same value.
.Pp
The following routines set color attributes.
For the list of accepted formats for specifying colors, see
.Xr AG_Color 3 .
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetColor
sets the foreground primary ("color").
.Fn AG_SetBgColor
sets the background primary ("background-color").
.Fn AG_SetTextColor
sets the color for text and vector icons ("text-color").
.Fn AG_SetLineColor
sets the color for lines and filled shapes ("line-color").
.Fn AG_SetHighColor
sets the shading color for top and left 3D-style edges ("high-color").
.Fn AG_SetLowColor
sets the shading color for bottom and right 3D-style edges ("low-color").
.Fn AG_SetSelColor
sets the primary for indicating active selections ("selection-color").
.Pp
The following routines set state-dependent color attributes
.Fn AG_Set<Color>Disabled
sets the given color for the widget "#disabled" state.
.Fn AG_Set<Color>Focused
sets the given color for the "#focused" state.
.Fn AG_Set<Color>Hover
sets the given color for the "#hover" state.

clears the DISABLED state and
.Fn AG_WidgetDisable
sets it.
These functions will raise the
.Sq widget-enabled
and
.Sq widget-disabled
events accordingly.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetEnabled
and
.Fn AG_WidgetDisabled
return the current state.
.Pp
.Fn AG_PushDisabledState
arranges for widgets subsequently attached to a container widget
.Fa obj
to start in DISABLED state.
The
.Fa AG_WIDGET_DISABLED
flag will be set on attach (without raising "widget-disabled").
.Sh FOCUS STATE
Focus enables reception of input events that would be filtered out by default.
The focused widget (in the currently focused window) will receive
"mouse-motion", "mouse-button-up", "key-up" and "key-down" events.

.Fn AG_WidgetFocus
focuses the specified widget and all of its parent widgets including
the parent
.Xr AG_Window 3 .
Returns 1 on success and 0 if the widget is not accepting focus.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetUnfocus
removes the focus state from the given widget and its children, recursively.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetIsFocused
returns 1 if the widget is both focused in relation to its parent window, and
the parent window itself is focused.
.Fn AG_WidgetIsFocusedInWindow
returns 1 if the widget is focused regardless of the focus state of its parent.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetForwardFocus

.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface "AG_Widget *obj" "int surface_id" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_WidgetBlit
function performs a software->hardware block image transfer ("blit") from the
surface
.Fa src
to the video display at the given widget coordinates.
.Fn AG_WidgetBlit
must invoked in rendering context.
See
.Xr AG_Surface 3
for more information on the Agar surface structure.
.Pp
Software to hardware blits are slow, so the
.Nm
system provides a way to manage hardware surfaces (i.e., textures) and take
advantage the texture capabilities of graphics hardware where it is available.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetMapSurface
registers the specified
.Xr AG_Surface 3
with the widget, returning an integer handle to that surface.
The surface can be subsequently rendered by calling
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface
or
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitFrom
using this handle.
The exact manner in which the surface is rendered depends on the Agar
driver in use.
For OpenGL-based drivers, a matching hardware texture is typically
generated on the initial call to
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface
and kept in cache for later use.
.Pp
By default, mapped surfaces are freed when the widget
is destroyed.
.Fn AG_WidgetMapSurfaceNODUP
sets the "NODUP" flag on the given surface such that the widget system
will never attempt to free the surface.
.Pp
Note that
.Fn AG_WidgetMapSurface
will not duplicate the surface.
Instead, it will register the given surface pointer to be managed by the
.Nm
system.
The surface pointer must remain valid for the lifetime of the widget (if in
doubt, you can always use
.Xr AG_SurfaceDup 3
to map a duplicate of the surface instead).
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetReplaceSurface
replaces the contents of a previously-mapped surface with
.Fa newSurface .
The
.Fn AG_WidgetReplaceSurfaceNODUP
variant avoids duplicating the surface and sets the "NODUP" flag.
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetUnmapSurface
destroys the given surface mapping.
It is equivalent to invoking
.Fn AG_WidgetReplaceSurface
with a NULL surface.
.Pp
In OpenGL mode,
.Fn AG_WidgetReplaceSurface
and
.Fn AG_WidgetUnmapSurface
do not operate on textures immediately.
GL texture delete operations are queued to be performed at the end of
the current event-processing cycle.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetUpdateSurface
function should be invoked whenever a mapped surface is changed.
If hardware surfaces are supported, it will cause an upload of the software
surface to the hardware (otherwise it is a no-op).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitFrom
function renders a previously mapped (possibly hardware) surface from the
source widget
.Fa srcWidget
(using source rectangle
.Fa rs )
onto the destination widget
.Fa obj ,
at coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y .
This function must be invoked in rendering context.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitSurface
variant invokes
.Fn AG_WidgetBlitFrom
with the same argument for both
.Fa srcWidget
and
.Fa obj
(and
.Fa rs
set to NULL).
.Sh USING BINDINGS
Widget states can be bound to memory locations containing data in a
supported format.
For example, the "state" binding of
.Xr AG_Button 3
can be tied to an integer (or bits in an integer), such that the user pressing
the button directly manipulates the integer value in memory.
.Pp
Bindings are documented under the heading
.Dq BINDINGS
section of the widget's manual page.
For instance,
.Xr AG_Slider 3
mentions "value" bindings to integers.
Therefore, to control a byte of memory, one might use:
.Bd -literal
.\" SYNTAX(c)
static Uint8 myByte = 0;

AG_Slider *slider = AG_SliderNew(window, AG_SLIDER_HORIZ, 0);
AG_BindUint8(slider, "value", &myByte);
.Ed
.Pp
Or alternatively, using a shorthand constructor:
.Bd -literal
.\" SYNTAX(c)
AG_SliderNewUint8(window, AG_SLIDER_HORIZ, 0, &myByte, NULL, NULL);
.Ed
.Pp
This method is not limited to primitive data types.
For example,
.Xr AG_Textbox 3
can bind to a fixed-size memory buffer containing a C string in ASCII,
UTF-8 or other supported encoding.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_Bind<Type>
family of functions bind widget states to memory data.
The
.Fn AG_Bind<Type>Mp
variants accept a pointer to a mutex which will be acquired prior to accessing
the data.
.Pp
Since the state of a widget can influence its appearance
(e.g.,
.Xr AG_Button 3
is drawn as a pressed button if its "state" is 1), it may be necessary to
monitor the value and redraw when it changes.
.Fn AG_RedrawOnChange
arranges for this to occur automatically (see below).

.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_RedrawOnTick "AG_Widget *obj" "int refresh_ms"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_Redraw
function signals that the widget must be redrawn to the video display.
It is equivalent to setting the
.Va dirty
variable of the widget's parent window to 1.
If called from rendering context,
.Fn AG_Redraw
is a no-op.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_RedrawOnChange
function arranges for the widget to be automatically redrawn whenever the
value associated with the existing binding
.Fa binding_name
changes.
The value of the binding will be checked at the specified interval
.Fa refresh_ms
in milliseconds.
If a
.Fa refresh_ms
argument of -1 is passed, the effect of any previous
.Fn AG_RedrawOnChange
call with the specified binding is disabled.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_RedrawOnTick
function arranges for the widget to be unconditionally redrawn at the
specified interval in milliseconds.
If a

The
.Fn AG_PushClipRect
function pushes a rectangle (in widget-relative coordinates) onto the stack of
clipping rectangles, and
.Fn AG_PopClipRect
pops the last entry from the clipping rectangle stack.
The effective clipping rectangle will be the intersection of all rectangles
on this stack.
Both functions must be invoked in rendering context.
.Pp
.Fn AG_PushBlendingMode
selects the source and destination functions for further pixel blending
operations.
It also pushes the current state onto the stack of alpha blending modes.
Setting
.Fa src
to
.Dv AG_ALPHA_ZERO
and
.Fa dst
to
.Dv AG_ALPHA_ONE
(the default) effectively disables blending.
Setting
.Fa src 
to
.Dv AG_ALPHA_SRC
and
.Fa dst
to
.Dv AG_ALPHA_ONE_MINUS_SRC
is the most common case.
See
.Xr AG_AlphaFn 3
for the list of possible alpha blending modes.
.Fn AG_PopBlendingMode
pops the the last entry off of the stack of alpha blending modes.
Both functions must be invoked from rendering context.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetDraw
routine renders a widget to the display.
It is typically invoked from an event loop routine (such as
.Xr AG_EventLoop 3 ) ,
to recursively draw the hierarchy of visible GUI elements.
.Pp
In the event loop,
.Fn AG_WidgetDraw
invocations must be enclosed between calls to
.Fn AG_BeginRendering
and
.Fn AG_EndRendering .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetHide
and
.Fn AG_WidgetShow
functions toggle the visibility of the specified widget (setting the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_HIDE
flag as appropriate).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetHideAll
and
.Fn AG_WidgetShowAll
routines toggle the visibility of the specified widget and its children
by setting the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_VISIBLE
flag (which works independently of
.Dv AG_WIDGET_HIDE ) .
These routines are intended to be used by container widgets (for example,
.Xr AG_Notebook 3
which needs to show or hide tabbed containers).
.Pp
.Fn AG_WidgetVisible
returns 1 if the widget is currently visible (equivalent to checking the
.Dv AG_WIDGET_VISIBLE
flag).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_WidgetSurface
routine renders the widget to a newly-allocated
.Xr AG_Surface 3 .
This surface should be freed after use.
.Sh WIDGET ACTIONS
User-generated events such as key presses or mouse button events can be
connected to high-level Widget
.Em actions ,
such as executing a specified routine or controlling a boolean.
Widget actions are described by the
.Fa AG_Action
structure.
.Pp
Where the conditions for execution of an Action are fixed (e.g., a specific
mouse button was clicked, or a specific key was pressed), use of
.Fn AG_ActionOn*
is preferred over low-level event handlers
(such as "key-down" or "mouse-button-down"), because it allows keyboard
and mouse bindings to be configured by the end-user in a standard way.
.Xr AG_Menu 3
also provides interfaces for working with widget actions.

.Fn AG_ActionFn
registers a new widget action which is to invoke a callback function
.Fa fn ,
with arguments
.Fa fnArgs .
See
.Xr AG_Event 3
for a description of the
.Fa fnArgs
format.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ActionSetInt
registers a new action which is to set an integer
.Fa variable
to a specified
.Fa value .
Instead of an integer variable,
.Fn AG_ActionSetFlag
sets the bits specified by
.Fa bitmask
to the specified
.Fa value
(of 1 or 0).
The
.Fn AG_ActionToggleInt
and
.Fn AG_ActionToggleFlag
variants do not take an explicit
.Fa value
argument, and toggle the current value instead.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ActionOnButtonDown
and
.Fn AG_ActionOnButtonUp
tie an action to a button press and a button release event, respectively.
The
.Fa button
argument specifies the button index (see
.Xr AG_MouseButton 3 ) .
.Fn AG_ActionOnKeyDown
and
.Fn AG_ActionOnKeyUp
tie an action to a key press and key release event, respectively.
The
.Fa sym
argument specifies the key (see
.Xr AG_KeySym 3 ) ,
and
.Fa mod
specifies the modifier keys which must be in effect.
To match any key or any modifier state,
.Dv AG_KEY_ANY
or
.Dv AG_KEYMOD_ANY
can be used.
.Pp
With
.Fn AG_ActionOnKeyDown
and
.Fn AG_ActionOnKeyUp ,
the action is triggered once immediately on key press or key release.
The
.Fn AG_ActionOnKey
variant ties an action to a key press, but with "key repeat" behavior.
The action is triggered immediately once after an initial key press.
If the key combination is held longer than the "key delay" (by default 250ms),
the event is repeated with the "key repeat" interval (by default 30ms).
.Pp
If there are currently no event handlers registered for "key-up", "key-down",
"mouse-button-up" and "mouse-button-down", the
.Fn AG_ActionOn*
functions automatically register event handlers which will invoke
.Fn AG_ExecMouseAction
or
.Fn AG_ExecKeyAction
as appropriate (see below).
.Pp
.Fn AG_ExecMouseAction
executes any action associated with mouse button events.
It is typically invoked from the "mouse-button-down" and "mouse-button-up"
event handlers of the widget.
Accepted
.Fa type
values are
.Dv AG_ACTION_ON_BUTTONDOWN
and
.Dv AG_ACTION_ON_BUTTONUP .
.Fa button
is the pressed button index (see
.Xr AG_MouseButton 3 ) .
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
is the position of the cursor in the widget's coordinate system.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ExecKeyAction
executes any action associated with keyboard events.
It is typically invoked from the "key-down" and "key-up"
event handlers of the widget.
Accepted
.Fa type
values are
.Dv AG_ACTION_ON_KEYDOWN
and
.Dv AG_ACTION_ON_KEYUP .
.Fa sym
and
.Fa mod
specify the key index and modifier state (see
.Xr AG_KeySym 3
and
.Xr AG_KeyMod 3 ) .
.Pp
.Fn AG_ExecAction
executes the specified action.
.Fn AG_ExecAction
is rarely used directly, but it is invoked internally by the
.Fn AG_ExecFooAction
functions.
.Sh EVENTS
