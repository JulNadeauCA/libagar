.Nd agar widget rendering primitives
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Agar provides a set of basic rendering operations designed for rendering GUI
elements efficiently (as opposed to general-purpose graphics, as would be
handled by libraries such as OpenGL or
.Xr VG 3 ) .
It is illegal to invoke these routines outside of the
.Fn draw
method of an
.Xr AG_Widget 3
(what we refer to as
.Sq rendering context ) .
.Pp
The
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
coordinates for the
.Fn AG_Draw*
routines are given in pixels in the
.Fa widget
argument's local coordinate system.

.nr nS 0
.Fn AG_PutPixel
sets the pixel at
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
to the native display color that most closely matches the given
.Xr AG_Color 3 .
The
.Fn AG_PutPixelRGB ,
.Fn AG_PutPixelRGB_8 ,
and
.Fn AG_PutPixelRGB_16
forms accept component values as separate arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PutPixel32
form accept an 8- to 32-bit wide pixel already in native display format.
Under
.Dv AG_LARGE ,
the
.Fn AG_PutPixel64
form also allows 48- and 64-bit wide pixel values.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_BlendPixel
function blends an existing pixel against a given
.Xr AG_Color 3 ,
overwriting the pixel with the best native-display approximation of the result.
.Pp
.Fn AG_BlendPixel32
and
.Fn AG_BlendPixel64
accept a 32- and 64-bit pixel value.
.Pp
Coordinates to
.Fn AG_PutPixel*
and
.Fn AG_BlendPixel*
are checked, and intersected against active clipping rectangles (see
.Xr AG_Widget 3 ) .
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawFrame
draws a 3D-style frame.
.Fn AG_DrawFrameBlended
draws a frame with alpha-blending, with the color
.Fa c
specified as an array of RGBA components, and the given blending mode.
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawCircle
draws a circle with the origin at
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
and a radius of
.Fa radius
pixels.
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawLine
scan-converts a line segment going from point
.Fa x1 ,
.Fa y1
to point
.Fa x2 ,
.Fa y2 .
The variants
.Fn AG_DrawLineH
and
.Fn AG_DrawLineV
render horizontal and vertical line segments, respectively.
.Fn AG_DrawLine2
renders two line segments for a 3D-style effect.
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawLineBlended
renders an alpha-blended line, where the RGBA components are passed as the
.Fa c
array, and the blending function is specified in
.Fa blendFn .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_DrawRect
function fills a destination rectangle with the specified color.
If the color is non-opaque, blending is performed.
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawRectOutline
draws the outline of a rectangle.
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawRectFilled
fills an opaque rectangle with the specified color, ignoring any alpha
component.
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawRectBlended
draws a blended rectangle of the color
.Fa c ,
specified as an array or RGBA components.
.Fn AG_DrawRectBlended
differs from
.Fn AG_DrawRect
in that it accepts an explicit blending mode
.Fa blendFn
(see
.Xr AG_AlphaFn 3
for details).

.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_DrawBox
routine draws a simple 3D-style box.
.Fa z
specifies the apparent 3D
.Sq depth ,
in pixels.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_DrawBoxDisabled
variant uses a stipple pattern of
.Fa c1
against
.Fa c2 .
.Fn AG_DrawBoxDisabled
is traditionally used to indicate a GUI element that is not responsive
to user input.
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawBoxRounded
renders a box with the edges rounded to the given
.Fa radius .
The
.Fn AG_DrawBoxRoundedTop
variant only rounds the top two corners.
.Pp
.Fn AG_DrawTiling
fills the rectangle
.Fa r
with a two-color tiling pattern.
.Fa tileSz
is the size of the tiles in pixels,
.Fa offset
is an offset in pixels and
.Fa c1 ,
.Fa c2
specify the colors of the tiles.

.Sh HISTORY
Simple widget primitives first appeared in Agar 1.0.
The basic rendering system was redesigned in Agar 1.4.
64-bit pixel access routines were added in Agar 1.6.
