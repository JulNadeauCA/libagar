.Sh NAME
.Nm SG_Plane
.Nd Agar-SG plane node
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/sg.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
node represents a reference geometrical plane.
This is useful in feature-based modeling, or as construction geometry.
The
.Nm
structure itself has no parameters.
The intrinsic node orientation is the normal vector (the
.Va a ,
.Va b ,
.Va c
coefficients) of the plane, and the
.Va d
coefficient is obtained from the node's world coordinates.
