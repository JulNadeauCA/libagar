#
# Typical BSDBuild Makefile for an Agar application.
#
# Get BSDBuild from: http://bsdbuild.hypertriton.com/. See: build.prog.mk(5).
#
# In finished Makefiles, please strip the overly verbose comments below:
# 

# Set to the base directory containing mk/ (required).
# To generate or update mk/, use the BSDBuild utility mkify(1).
TOP=../..

# Pull in definitions generated by the configure script.
include ./Makefile.config

# For recursion, use SUBDIR:
# SUBDIR=mydir1 mydir2 ...

# Base executable name (subject to prefixing, suffixing and transforms).
PROG=agarhello

# Type of program (GUI|CLI|DAEMON, default CLI).
PROG_TYPE="GUI"

# Unique identifier. Generate this using uuidgen(1):
PROG_GUID=""

#
# Source files. See build.prog.mk(5) for the full list of recognized
# languages and file extensions.
#
SRCS=	agarhello.c
#SRCS+=	foo.cc foo.m foo.asm foo.ads foo.adb foo.cob foo.l foo.y

#
# Add the compiler flags and libraries required by ag_gui (implies ag_core).
#
# ${AGAR_CFLAGS} and ${AGAR_LIBS} are defined in Makefile.config (itself
# generated by the configure script, more specifically the code emitted by
# "check(agar)" or "require(agar)" directives in configure.in).
#
CFLAGS+=${AGAR_CFLAGS}
LIBS+=	${AGAR_LIBS}

# This is required since we are building a program.
include ${TOP}/mk/build.prog.mk
