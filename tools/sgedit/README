What is it?
-----------
sgedit is an editor for SG(3) scenes. It is meant as a convenient tool for
editing scenes built into applications. The sgedit program itself is minimal,
since most of the edition features are built into the SG node classes
themselves.

License
-------
sgedit is freely distributable under the same license as Agar itself,
a revised two-clause BSD license (http://libagar.org/license.html).
