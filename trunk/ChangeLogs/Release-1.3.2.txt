Release Notes for Agar 1.3.2 (Landscapes Turn to Ash)
-----------------------------------------------------

Here are some of the notable changes since Agar 1.3.1 in no particular order.
For a complete list of all changes, see ChangeLog-1.3.2.txt.

- Thorough audit and clean up of thread-safety code. It is now safe to combine
  threads and OpenGL. The big VFS lock has been removed (AG_LockVFS now locks
  its argument's VFS root).
- Compilation fixes for MacOS X 10.5.
- Various manual page updates and improvements.
- The --enable-nls configure option works again; updated French translation.

- CORE: Implemented AG_ObjectSetDebugFn(), AG_ObjectSuperclass().
- CORE: Added LOCKDEBUG compile option for expensive per-object lock debugging.

- GUI: The AG_Textbox(3) widget has been mostly rewritten. A lower-level
       AG_Editable(3) widget is now provided, and AG_Textbox(3) now mostly
       augments that functionality with padding, scrollbars and labels.
- GUI: Multiline text edition has been improved significantly.
- GUI: Added traditional ISO-8859-1 combination keymap for AG_Textbox(3).
- GUI: It is now possible to bind an ASCII-only text buffer to AG_Textbox(3),
       in cases where UTF-8 is not desirable.
- GUI: Added cursor manipulation routines to AG_Textbox(3)/AG_Editable(3).
- GUI: Implemented iconification of windows in the built-in window manager;
       added AG_WindowSetIcon() to change the default icon.
- GUI: Implemented AG_IconSetText() in AG_Icon(3).
- GUI: Fixed undersize behavior of AG_Menu(3).
- GUI: Added support for quad-precision floating point bindings for systems
       where the type is supported.
- GUI: Adjusted numerical limit definitions that would cause problems with
       some compilers.
- GUI: Implement AG_DrawBoxRounded().
- GUI: Fix multiline text rendering in AG_TextRender(); fix from Renato Aguiar.
- GUI: Implement AG_CheckboxNewFn(), AG_CHECKBOX_SET.
- GUI: Various cosmetic fixes with the default theme.
- GUI: Add AG_FILEDLG_ASYNC flag to AG_FileDlg(3).
- GUI: Make theme changes effective immediately in AG_SetStyle().
- GUI: Allow arbitrary widgets to be embedded into AG_Table(3).
- GUI: Implement AG_TableSetSeparator().
- GUI: Add AG_NumericalNewFoo() constructors to AG_Numerical(3).
- GUI: Keep the stack of saved OpenGL clipping planes in the Widget structure
       itself to avoid implementation-specific OpenGL stack limits.
- GUI: AG_WidgetMapSurface() is now safe to invoke from any context, which
       should simplify widget code. In OpenGL mode, the actual texture uploads
       and deletions are now queued for execution in rendering context.
- GUI: Implement AG_WidgetBlitSurfaceFlippedGL().
- GUI: Fix off-by-ones in OpenGL clipping plane setup.
- GUI: Fix mouse-wheel scrolling in AG_Table(3).
- GUI: Implemented AG_ScrollbarSet{Inc,Dec}Fn() for special applications.
- GUI: Implemented AG_WindowRestoreGeometry(), AG_WindowUnminimize().
- GUI: Implemented AG_WINDOW_HMAXIMIZE and AG_WINDOW_VMAXIMIZE flag into
       AG_Window(3) to preserve maximization through VIDEORESIZE.
- GUI: Fixed text truncation in AG_Titlebar(3).
- GUI: Implemented AG_ClearGlobalKeys().
- GUI: Implemented AG_SocketOverlayFn().
- GUI: Fixed keyboard handling in AG_Table(3) and AG_Tlist(3).
