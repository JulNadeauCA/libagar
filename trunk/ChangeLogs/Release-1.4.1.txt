http://wiki.libagar.org/wiki/Agar-1.4.1.

- Fixed compilation with --disable-legacy option.
- Implemented AG_SurfaceFromPNG() and AG_SurfaceFromJPEG().
- Fixed crash bug in AG_SurfaceFromSDL(); thanks trapdoor!
- Added AG_SetJPEGQuality(), to set quality used by AG_SurfaceExportJPEG().
- Merge --enable-{class,event}debug into --enable-objdebug; remove lockdebug.
- Upgrade build system to BSDBuild 2.8. Note that stale ./agar-config/ and
  ./agar-foo-config/ directories may break the build and should be removed
  before ./configure is executed.
