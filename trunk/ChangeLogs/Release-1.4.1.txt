Release Notes for Agar 1.4.1
----------------------------

Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.4.0, in no
particular order. A wikified version of this list is available at:
http://wiki.libagar.org/wiki/Agar-1.4.1.

- Widget code can now use the AG_Redraw() and AG_RedrawOn*() interfaces to
  trigger rendering. The generic event loop uses this information to avoid
  unnecessary video updates -- custom event loops should be modified to
  test for the window "dirty" flag to take advantage of this feature.
- Fixed compilation with --disable-legacy option.
- Implemented AG_SurfaceFromPNG() and AG_SurfaceFromJPEG().
- Fixed crash bug in AG_SurfaceFromSDL(); thanks trapdoor!
- Added AG_SetJPEGQuality(), to set quality used by AG_SurfaceExportJPEG().
- Merge --enable-{class,event}debug into --enable-objdebug; remove lockdebug.
- Upgrade build system to BSDBuild 2.8. Note that stale ./agar-config/ and
  ./agar-foo-config/ directories may break the build and should be removed
  before ./configure is executed.
- Fix deadlock condition with the AG_Timeout interface when timers are
  scheduled in reverse order; thanks to Jakob Reschke for the fix!
- Fixed UTF8 conversion bug with 3-byte sequences; thanks Jerry Huang!
- Fixed coordinates offset for popup menus under single-window drivers.
- Added AG_InitGraphics(3) as a separate manual page.
- Fixed crash bug with AG_TEXTBOX_STATIC and AG_EDITABLE_STATIC.
- Added "STRUCTURE DATA" section to AG_Window(3).
- Added missing SDL_LockSurface() calls in sdlfb/sdlgl drivers.
- AG_InitGraphics() can now accept driver initialization arguments.
- Added AG_DriverGLX(3), AG_DriverWGL(3), AG_DriverSDLFB(3),
  AG_DriverSDLGL(3), AG_DriverMw(3) and AG_DriverSw(3) manual pages.
- Avoid use of gettimeofday() on cygwin platform.
- MATH: Fix type conversion warnings.
