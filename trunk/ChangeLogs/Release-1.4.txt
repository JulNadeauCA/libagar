Release Notes for Agar 1.4 (Landscapes of Frozen Methane)
---------------------------------------------------------

(Work in progress)

Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.3.4, in no
particular order. A wikified version of this list is available at:
http://wiki.libagar.org/wiki/Agar-1.4.

- Added support for multiple native windows; rework of the basic graphics
  and input device interface. As of this release, the available drivers are:
  - "glx" (GL rendering via X Window System; multiple windows)
  - "wgl" (GL rendering under Windows; multiple windows)
  - "sdlfb" (framebuffer rendering via SDL; single window)
  - "sdlgl" (GL rendering via SDL; single window)
- Applications should now use AG_InitGraphics() to initialize the graphical
  interface. Backward compatibility is preserved, but AG_InitVideo() will
  only select among single-window graphics drivers.
- Agar can now be built without the SDL library, where the SDL graphics
  driver is not needed.
- Implement widget "actions" as a generic method of handling mouse and
  keyboard actions per user preferences (see AG_Widget(3)/ACTIONS).
- Windows are now attached, like widgets, using generic AG_ObjectAttach()
  and AG_ObjectDetach(), against a parent AG_Driver(3). With multiple-window
  drivers, there is one Driver instance per Window. AG_ViewDetach() is now
  marked deprecated.
- Added AG_Tbl(3), AG_Tree(3) interfaces to ag_core.
- Fix handling of dynamically-allocated strings in AG_CopyVariable().
- Implement AG_TlistUniq(), AG_TlistAddHead().
- Avoid a very inefficient tree traversal in AG_LookupClass() by keeping
  a separate hash table for class specification strings.
- Consistently provide plain string variants for every function accepting
  format string arguments. This allows for more efficient code, and avoids
  complications with language bindings.
- As the "window-*" prefixes in events such as "window-mousemotion" is no
  longer relevant, mark them deprecated in favor of "mouse-*" and "key-*".
- The integer typedefs Uint8, Sint8, Uint16, Sint16, etc. are no longer
  made public unless _USE_AGAR_TYPES is defined.
- AG_Textbox(3) now uses AG_Label(3) to display its optional text label.
- Added AG_TextboxSetFont(), AG_EditableSetFont(). The "font" structure
  members of AG_Textbox(3) and AG_Editable(3) are now public.
- Various improvements to AG_Console(3), added scrolling actions.
- Implement AG_SCROLLBAR_AUTOSIZE option in AG_Scrollbar(3).
