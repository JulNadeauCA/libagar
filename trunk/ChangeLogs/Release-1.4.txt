Release Notes for Agar 1.4 (Landscapes of Frozen Methane)
---------------------------------------------------------

Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.3.4, in no
particular order. A wikified version of this list is available at:
http://wiki.libagar.org/wiki/Agar-1.4.

This release preserves backward compatibility with Agar 1.3.4, but it is
recommended to compile Agar with the `--disable-legacy' configure option,
ensuring that existing applications are not using deprecated API calls.

- Added support for multiple native windows; rework of the low-level graphics
  and input device interfaces. As of this release, the available drivers are:
  - "glx" (GL rendering via X Window System; multiple windows)
  - "wgl" (GL rendering under Windows; multiple windows)
  - "sdlfb" (framebuffer rendering via SDL; internal WM)
  - "sdlgl" (GL rendering via SDL; internal WM)
  New drivers can also be implemented as part of an application, the driver
  API is documented in AG_Driver(3).
- Applications should now use AG_InitGraphics() to initialize the graphical
  interface. Backward compatibility is preserved, but AG_InitVideo() will
  only select among single-window graphics drivers.
- Agar can now be built without the SDL library, where the SDL graphics
  driver is not needed.
- Many improvements to the AG_Surface(3) interface.
- Implement generic AG_Keyboard and AG_Mouse interfaces; allow for multiple
  input devices.
- Implement widget "actions" as a generic method of handling mouse and
  keyboard actions per user preferences (see AG_Widget(3)/ACTIONS).
- Agar windows are now attached and detached using AG_ObjectAttach() and
  AG_ObjectDetach() against a parent AG_Driver(3); the AG_ViewDetach()
  function is now deprecated.
- Added AG_Tbl(3), AG_Tree(3) interfaces to ag_core.
- Fix handling of dynamically-allocated strings in AG_CopyVariable().
- Implement AG_TlistUniq(), AG_TlistAddHead().
- Important optimizations to AG_LookupClass().
- Consistently provide plain string variants for every function accepting
  format string arguments. This allows for more efficient code, and avoids
  complications with language bindings.
- As the "window-*" prefixes in events such as "window-mousemotion" is no
  longer relevant, mark them deprecated in favor of "mouse-*" and "key-*".
- The integer typedefs Uint8, Sint8, Uint16, Sint16, etc. are no longer
  made public unless _USE_AGAR_TYPES is explicitely defined.
- Widgets such as AG_Textbox(3) now embed AG_Label(3) widgets to display
  their associated text labels.
- Added AG_TextboxSetFont(), AG_EditableSetFont(), AG_ConsoleSetFont().
- Various additions to AG_Console(3).
- It is now possible to have the AG_Scrollbar(3) control size scaled
  automatically from the "visible" binding, by enabling AG_SCROLLBAR_AUTOSIZE.
- Consistently represent color values using AG_Color(3) throughout the API.
- Many additions and updates to the API reference.
- Added various size hint routines: AG_ProgressBarSetLength(),
  AG_ScrollbarSizeHint().
- Fixed a few memory leaks on AG_Destroy(); added demos/reinit/ test case.
- Cursor changes are no longer performed directly from widget code. Instead,
  widgets now register "cursor change areas" via the AG_Cursor(3) interface.
- Introduce AG_EventQ structure, 
- Added AG_ObjectSetAttachFn(), AG_ObjectSetDetachFn(), AG_ObjectMoveToHead()
  and AG_ObjectMoveToTail() functions, allowing the order of child objects
  to be controlled. This is used by AG_Window(3) where order is important.
- Implemented AG_ShortFilename() utility routine.
- VG: Implemented VG_Status(), VG_TextString(). VG_View(3) now uses widget
  actions.
- The default theme now allows transparency in the color scheme.
