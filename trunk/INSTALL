Prerequisites
-------------
Agar currently requires the SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/). Note: this
requirement will be removed Agar-1.4, as SDL code will be moved to a
module.

Options
-------
- The FreeType library (http://www.freetype.org/) is required for high
  quality font rendering. If compiled without FreeType, Agar will revert
  to a simple bitmap font engine. The bitmap font bundled with Agar only
  includes the ASCII range.

- The GL rendering mode requires OpenGL. Agar can be compiled with runtime
  support for both SDL and OpenGL modes.

- The optional "screenshot" feature requires the jpeg library, available
  from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.

- Threads support (--enable-threads) requires a POSIX threads interface
  which conforms to SUSv2 (i.e., recursive mutexes are needed).

Installation
------------
1) Execute the configure script (use `./configure --help' for options;
   in particular, you may want to use --without-manpages to speed up the
   build if you do not want manual pages).
    $ ./configure

2) Compile the libraries and executables.
    $ make depend all
    # make install

3) Let the developers know of your success/failure.
    $ cat config.log | mail -s "compiles fine" compile@libagar.org

Alternative method: Concurrent building
---------------------------------------
It is possible to build Agar outside of the source directory. Developers
will generally prefer this method, since it results in a faster build,
does not clutter the source directories with object files and facilitates
testing on multiple machines using network filesystems. The inconvenient
of concurrent building is that configure needs to be rerun whenever a
Makefile is modified.

1) Create the build directory. When available, a memory filesystem is
   a good location to build from.
    $ mkdir w-agar
    $ cd w-agar

2) Run configure from the source directory with --srcdir.
    $ ~/agar-sources/configure --srcdir=$HOME/agar-sources [...]

3) Now build the libraries and executables as you normally would.
    $ make depend && make
    # make install
