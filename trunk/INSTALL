1) Execute the configure script (see ./configure --help for options).
   
   $ ./configure

2) Build dependencies with the depend target. If you are hacking the
   code, note that the dependencies are honored only if your make(1)
   reads `.depend' files (a non-standard BSD extension).

   $ make depend

3) Compile the library, binaries, data files and preformat manual pages.

   $ make

4) Install the library, binaries, data files and manual pages. If prefix
   is /usr/local, /usr/local/share/agar/man may be registered with man(1).

   # make install

   Alternatively, if you are hacking the agar source, invoke the `links'
   target to create ~/.cave symbolic links to data files inside the source
   tree.

   $ cd ./cave && make links

6) Execute the game by running `cave'.

   $ cave

   The level editor (if compiled in), is invoked with the -e flag.

   $ cave -e

$Csoft$
