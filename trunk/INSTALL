1) Execute the configure script (see ./configure --help for options):
   $ ./configure

2) Build dependencies with the depend target:
   $ make depend

3) Compile the library, binaries, data files and preformat manual pages:
   $ make

4) Install the library, binaries, data files and manual pages:
   # make install

   Alternatively, to use/modify the data files of the source tree, use
   the `links' target, symlinks will be made into ~/.cave:
   $ make links

5) Register the manual page directory path. Under BSD, /etc/man.conf should
   include (prefix)/share/agar/man.

6) Execute the game by running `cave':
   $ cave

   The level editor (if compiled in), is invoked with -e:
   $ cave -e
