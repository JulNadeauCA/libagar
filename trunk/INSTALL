Prerequisites
-------------
Agar requires the Software DirectMedia Layer (http://www.libsdl.org/)
library.

Options
-------
- The FreeType library (http://www.freetype.org/) is required for high
  quality font rendering. If compiled without FreeType, Agar will revert
  to a simple bitmap font engine.

- The GL rendering mode requires OpenGL.

- The screenshot feature requires the jpeg library, available from
  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.

- Threads support (--enable-threads) requires a POSIX threads interface
  which conforms to SUSv2 (ie. recursive mutexes are needed).

Installation
------------
1) Execute the configure script (use `./configure --help' for options).
   $ ./configure

2) Build the dependencies with the `depend' target.
   $ make depend

3) Compile the libs, binaries, archives and man pages (if nroff(1) is there).
   $ make

4) Install the libs, binaries, data files and manual pages.
   # make install

5) Let the developers know of the success or failure you encountered.
   $ cat config.log | \
     mail -s "compiles and runs ok" report@agar.csoft.org

Concurrent building
-------------------
It is possible to build Agar outside of the source directory. Developers
will generally prefer this method, since it results in a faster build,
does not clutter the source directories with object files and facilitates
testing on multiple machines using network filesystems. The inconvenient
of concurrent building is that configure needs to be rerun whenever a
Makefile is modified.

1) Create the build directory.
   $ mkdir w-agar; cd w-agar

2) Run configure from the source directory with --srcdir.
   $ ~/agar-sources/configure --srcdir=$HOME/agar-sources [...]

3) Build Agar as with the standard method.
   $ make depend && make
   # make install
