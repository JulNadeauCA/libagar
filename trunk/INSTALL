Prerequisites
-------------
Agar requires the Software DirectMedia Layer (http://www.libsdl.org) as
well as the FreeType library (http://www.freetype.org).

Options
-------
- The experimental GL mode (-g) requires an OpenGL library.

- The video playback option requires the smpeg library, available from
  http://www.icculus.org/smpeg/.

- The screenshot feature (F9) requires the jpeg library, available from
  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.

- Threads support (--enable-threads) requires POSIX threads.

- Network support requires the libqnet library, available from:
  http://libqnet.csoft.org/.

Installation
------------
1) Execute the configure script (use `./configure --help' for options).
   $ ./configure

2) Build the dependencies with the `depend' target.
   $ make depend

3) Compile the libs, binaries, archives and man pages (if nroff(1) is there).
   $ make

4) Install the libs, binaries, data files and manual pages.
   # make install

5) Let the developers know of the success or failure you encountered.
   $ cat config.log | \
     mail -s "compiles and runs ok" report@agar.csoft.org

Concurrent building
-------------------
It is possible to build Agar outside of the source directory. Developers
will generally prefer this method, since it results in a faster build,
does not clutter the source directories with object files and facilitates
testing on multiple machines using network filesystems. The inconvenient
of concurrent building is that configure needs to be rerun whenever a
Makefile is modified.

For instance, on a 1.44GHz Apple PowerBook G4, a concurrent build takes
about 2m26s, while a regular build takes 2m90s (building from scratch).
However, "make && make install" with concurrent building takes 18s
versus 33s for the regular method.

1) Create the build directory.
   $ mkdir w-agar; cd w-agar

2) Run configure from the source directory with --srcdir.
   $ ~/agar-sources/configure --srcdir=$HOME/agar-sources [...]

3) Build Agar as with the standard method.
   $ make depend && make
   # make install
