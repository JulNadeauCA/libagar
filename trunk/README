What is it?
-----------
Agar is a type of sugar polymer obtained from seaweed and red algae. Agar
becomes gelatinous in water and is primarly used as a culture medium for
microbiological work. Agar is also the name of an open source toolkit for
portable graphical applications.

Agar consists of two libraries: Agar-Core and Agar-GUI. Agar-Core implements
an object system and portability interfaces. Agar-GUI is an extensive GUI
toolkit designed to work with anything that has a display and a pointing
device (or keyboard). Currently, it provides drivers for SDL and OpenGL.

This distribution also includes other useful libraries based on Agar, but
you will need to link explicitely against them:

Agar-DEV	Developer/debugging tools	`agar-dev-config --libs`
Agar-VG		Vector display engine		`agar-vg-config --libs`
Agar-RG		2D graphic rendering/edition	`agar-rg-config --libs`
Agar-SC		Scientific computing routines	`agar-sc-config --libs`
Agar-MAP	2D game levels/edition		`agar-map-config --libs`

Other libraries distributed separatedly include Agar-SG, a 3D geometry
and graphics engine, available from http://hypertriton.com/agar-sg/ and
cadtools, available from http://hypertriton.com/cadtools/.
