What is it?
-----------
Agar is a type of sugar polymer obtained from seaweed and red algae. Agar
becomes gelatinous in water and is primarly used as a culture medium for
microbiological work. Agar is also the name of an open source GUI toolkit.

Agar is designed to work under any graphics system, on any platform. Some
graphics drivers are single-display (e.g., sdlfb, sdlgl), and other drivers
can provide multiple "native" windows (e.g., glx). Multiple Agar windows are
supported regardless of the underlying graphics driver. Under single-display
drivers, Agar emulates a window manager internally. The Agar application need
not to be aware of the underlying graphics system.

The OpenGL graphics drivers are preferred where hardware acceleration is
available. Drivers for direct rendering to framebuffers are also provided.
As far as the default "theme" is concerned, the appearance of GUI elements
is unchanged across graphics drivers.

A set of standard, common widgets are included in the Agar-GUI library.
Agar is designed such that new widgets can be easily implemented as part
of a separate third-party library or application.

The Agar-Core library provides various utility and portability interfaces,
as well as the "object system" used by Agar and several other libraries.
The object system implements inheritance, serialization, virtual functions,
timers, threads and variable bindings.

Agar is entirely thread-safe when built with thread support. Thread-safety
considerations are documented in the API reference; see AG_Threads(3) for
details.

- The API Reference. This is a detailed description of all public Agar
  structures, objects and functions. On Unix-like systems, it is installed
  in traditional manual page format (see AG_Intro(3)). The API Reference
  is also available online at:

Portability
-----------
Agar is portable to many different platforms, including FreeBSD, IRIX,
Linux, MacOS Classic, MacOS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Windows. It
has even been ported to various consoles such as the GP2x, Nintendo
Gamecube/Wii, Sony Playstation2 and Nintendo DS. For the list of official
ports, see: http://libagar.org/portable.html.
