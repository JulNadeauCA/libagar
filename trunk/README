What is it?
-----------
Agar is a type of sugar polymer obtained from seaweed and red algae. Agar
becomes gelatinous in water and is primarly used as a culture medium for
microbiological work. Agar is also a framework for graphical applications
using SDL or OpenGL.

Agar is most well-known for its extensive GUI library, which is being used
by games, game edition tools, CAD and scientific applications.

The Agar core library features an object system which implements event and
timing facilities, archiving, memory management, dependency keeping and a
graphical edition framework.

The distribution also includes a vector drawing engine, a map system and
a flexible image/animation editor which can be built into applications
such as games, for purposes of retouching, composition and authoring.

Availability
------------
You can download the most recent Agar version from the Agar home page
at http://agar.csoft.org/, or the SourceForge project page.

Portability
