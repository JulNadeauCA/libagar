What is it?
-----------
Agar is a type of sugar polymer obtained from seaweed and red algae. Agar
becomes gelatinous in water and is primarly used as a culture medium for
microbiological work. Agar is also a framework for graphical applications
using SDL or OpenGL.

Agar is most well-known for its GUI toolkit, which is sophisticated enough
to accomodate applications such as CAD, 3D modeling and game/level edition.
But Agar is much more than a GUI. The GUI toolkit is only a small part of
the project. Agar was initially designed as a game engine for our upcoming
game, "Trek to the Cave", and it implements an object system which allows
it to function essentially as an interpreter.

That is, an Agar game can be constructed entirely from data files created
by the the built-in graphical edition facilties. Agar manages memory and
persistence. Typically, all of the code needed by an Agar game will take
the form of object implementations, and some simple games which make use
of the built-in object types will not require any code at all (besides
the initialization in main(), of course). Agar provides some built-in object
implementations, such as "map" for tile-based 2D levels, "vgobj" for vector
drawings and "perso" for simple game characters.

Availability
------------
You can download the most recent Agar version from the Agar home page
at http://agar.csoft.org/, or the SourceForge project page.

Portability
-----------
Thanks to SDL, Agar is portable to many different platforms, including
FreeBSD, IRIX, Linux, MacOS Classic, MacOS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Windows.
