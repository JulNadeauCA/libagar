What is it?
-----------
Agar is a type of sugar polymer obtained from seaweed and red algae. Agar
becomes gelatinous in water and is primarly used as a culture medium for
microbiological work. Agar is also an extensive toolkit for graphical
applications.

Agar is most well-known for its GUI library, Agar-GUI, which is being used
by games, game edition tools, CAD and scientific applications.

Included in this distribution are the core Agar library (Agar-Core) which
focuses on an object system providing archiving (virtual filesystem),
events/timers, dependency management and memory management. Optional
features of Agar-Core include graphical edition facilities and a network
revision control system specific to Agar objects (used for faciliating
team development of complex datasets).

This distribution also includes a number of independent libraries:
