What is it?
-----------
Agar is a type of sugar polymer obtained from seaweed and red algae. Agar
becomes gelatinous in water and is primarly used as a culture medium for
microbiological work. Agar is also a toolkit for graphical applications
using SDL or OpenGL.

Agar is most well-known for its extensive GUI library, Agar-GUI, which is
being used by games, game edition tools, CAD and scientific applications.

This distribution also includes the Agar-Core library. The main feature of
Agar-Core is a generic object system which implements event and timing
facilities, archiving of complex structures with interdependencies, memory
management, a graphical edition framework and even a specialized revision
control system.

Other libraries that rely on Agar-Core/Agar-GUI include Agar-SG (scene
graph and 3D engine), Agar-VG (vector graphics), Agar-RG (image authoring)
and more. See the Agar homepage for more information of the available
libraires.
