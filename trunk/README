What is it?
-----------
Agar is a type of sugar polymer obtained from seaweed and red algae. Agar
becomes gelatinous in water and is primarly used as a culture medium for
microbiological work. Agar is also the name of an open source GUI toolkit
designed to work in an unobtrusive way, under a great variety of platforms.

As of this release, Agar provides rendering backends for SDL and OpenGL.
The OpenGL mode is preferred when hardware acceleration is available as
it makes efficient use of it. The SDL mode is more efficient when only
plain a framebuffer is available. The appearance of the GUI is completely
customizable, and Agar's object system simplifies the task of creating
new widgets.

The Agar-Core library provides a simple object system which allows for a
lightweight, consistent and portable form of object-oriented programming
under multiple languages (the standard Agar libraries use ANSI C; bindings
to Perl and Ada are provided for the Core and GUI libraries). The main
features of the object system are inheritance, serialization, virtual
functions / events and per-object management of resources such as timers
and threads. A number of portability interfaces are also provided.

In addition to these two main libraries, this distribution also includes
Agar-VG, Agar-RG, Agar-DEV and Agar-MATH (see below).

Documentation
-------------
API documentation is provided in the form of traditional Unix manual pages
and HTML. You can read the manual online or download the pages in HTML or
printable format from the Agar website at http://libagar.org/docs/.

Portability
-----------
Agar is portable to many different platforms, including FreeBSD, IRIX,
Linux, MacOS Classic, MacOS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Windows. It
has even been ported to various consoles such as the GP2x, Nintendo
Gamecube/Wii, Sony Playstation2 and Nintendo DS. For the list of official
ports, see: http://libagar.org/portable.html.
