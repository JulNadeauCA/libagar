.Sh NAME
.Nm AU_DevOut
.Nd agar audio output interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/au.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides basic audio output functionality, using different
drivers to interface with different audio systems.
.Sh INTERFACE
.nr nS 1
.Ft "AU_DevOut *"
.Fn AU_OpenOut "const char *path" "int rate" "int channels"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AU_CloseOut "AU_DevOut *dev"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AU_AddChannel "AU_DevOut *dev"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AU_DelChannel "AU_DevOut *dev" "int channel"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AU_WriteFloat "AU_DevOut *dev" "float *data" "size_t frames"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AU_OpenOut
function opens the specified output device.
The
.Fa path
argument should contain the name of the output driver, with optional
arguments in round brackets.
For example,
.Sq pa
opens the PortAudio output driver, if available.
The
.Sq file(foo.wav)
argument specifies the "file" driver with an output filename argument.
The
.Fa rate
argument is the requested sampling rate in Hz, and
.Fa channels
is the requested number of channels (if the device is unable to handle
those settings, the call will fail).
On success, a device handle is returned.
.Pp
.Fn AU_CloseOut
closes the specified output device.
.Pp
Every output device has an associated set of virtual channels, which is
independent from the number of channels supported by the underlying device
(software mixing is done if necessary).
The
.Fn AU_AddChannel
function adds a new virtual channel to the given output device.
.Fn AU_DelChannel
deletes the specified channel.
.Pp
The
.Fn AU_WriteFloat
routine writes one or more frames to the output device.
A single frame should contain one
.Ft float
per channel.

.Xr AU_Wave 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Xr AU 3
library and the
.Nm
interface first appeared in Agar 1.5.0.
