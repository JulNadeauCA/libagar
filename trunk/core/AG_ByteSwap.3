.Nd agar byte swapping macros
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core/byteswap.h>

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These macros swap the order of bytes in integers and floating-point types.
They are useful when reading or writing data of a specific endianness.

The functions
.Fn AG_Swap16 ,
.Fn AG_Swap32 ,
.Fn AG_Swap64 ,
.Fn AG_SwapFLT ,
.Fn AG_SwapDBL
and
.Fn AG_SwapLDBL
return the given value with the byte order reversed.
.Pp
.Fn AG_SwapLE16 ,
.Fn AG_SwapLE32 ,
.Fn AG_SwapLE64 ,
.Fn AG_SwapLEFLT ,
.Fn AG_SwapLEDBL
and
.Fn AG_SwapLELDBL
returns the given value with the byte order reversed if the current
architecture is big-endian.
On little-endian machines, these functions return the value unchanged.
.Pp
.Fn AG_SwapBE16 ,
.Fn AG_SwapBE32 ,
.Fn AG_SwapBE64 ,
.Fn AG_SwapBEFLT ,
.Fn AG_SwapBEDBL
and
.Fn AG_SwapBELDBL
returns the given value with the byte order reversed if the current
architecture is little-endian.
On big-endian machines, these functions return the value unchanged.
.Pp
If 64-bit types are not supported,
.Fn AG_Swap64 ,
.Fn AG_SwapLE64
and
.Fn AG_SwapBE64
are not defined.
If quad-precision arithmetic is not supported,
.Fn AG_SwapLDBL ,
.Fn AG_SwapLELDBL
and
.Fn AG_SwapBELDBL
are not defined.
