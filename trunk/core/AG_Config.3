.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Config
.Nd agar configuration interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar
.Nm
interface (accessed via the global
.Va agConfig
object) manages persistent Agar configuration settings, which are
stored as
.Xr AG_Variable 3
values and bindings.
.Pp
Application-specific data may also be stored in
.Va agConfig ,
as long as the variable names don't start with the "ag_" prefix which
is reserved for Agar settings.
.Sh INTERFACE
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_ConfigLoad "void"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_ConfigSave "void"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_ConfigFile "const char *path_key" "const char *name" "const char *extension" "char *dst_path" "size_t dst_len"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_ConfigLoad
function loads the configuration data from disk, returning 0 on sucess
or -1 if an error occured.
It is equivalent to calling:
.Bd -literal
	AG_ObjectLoad(agConfig);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ConfigSave
function saves the configuration data, creating the parent directories if
needed.
Returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.
It is equivalent to:
.Bd -literal
	AG_CreateDataDir();
	AG_ObjectSave(agConfig);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ConfigFile
utility routine searches a colon-separated pathname setting (i.e.,
.Sq load-path )
for a file with the given
.Fa name
and
.Fa extension.
If the file is found, its full pathname is copied into a target
fixed-size buffer
.Fa dst_path
(limited to
.Fa dst_len
bytes).
.Fn AG_ConfigFile
returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
.Sh CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
The following parameters are registered by Agar-Core:
.Bl -tag -width "BOOL initial-run "
.It Va BOOL initial-run
Application is being ran for the first time (read-only).
.It Va STRING load-path
Directory containing data files for the
.Xr AG_Object 3
virtual filesystem, as well as the
.Nm
data itself.
Default is platform-dependent.
.It Va STRING save-path
Target directory for writing the
.Xr AG_Object 3
virtual filesystem (usually the same as
.Sq load-path ) .
.It Va STRING tmp-path
Directory for temporary files.
Default is platform-dependent (on POSIX platforms, the
.Ev TMPDIR
environment variable is honored).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code sets an integer option and a string.
The configuration is then immediately saved to disk:
.Bd -literal
	AG_SetInt(agConfig, "my-setting", 1);
	AG_SetString(agConfig, "my-string", "Foo bar");
	AG_ConfigSave();
.Ed
.Pp
The following Agar-GUI code displays a checkbox controlling the value
of "my-setting":
.Bd -literal
	AG_Checkbox *cb;
	
	cb = AG_CheckboxNew(win, 0, "My setting");
	AG_BindVariable(cb, "state", agConfig, "my-setting");
.Ed
.Pp
The following code binds "my-ext-setting" to an external variable, and then
reads the configuration from disk.
If the saved configuration has "my-ext-setting" defined, then the variable will
be set accordingly:
.Bd -literal
	int myExtSetting = 0;
	
	AG_BindInt(agConfig, "my-ext-setting", &myExtSetting);
	AG_ConfigLoad();
