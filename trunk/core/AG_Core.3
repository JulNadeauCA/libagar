.Dt AG_CORE 3
.Os
.ds vT Agar API Reference
.ds oS Agar 1.0
.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Core
.Nd agar core library initialization
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar
.Nm
library implements the base Agar object system.
Even though the Agar-GUI library is built on top of it,
.Nm
is an independent, general utility library (containing no GUI-related code),
and may be used in any application.
.Nm
provides a number of interfaces:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet
.It
The standard
.Xr AG_EventLoop 3 ,
with the
.Xr AG_EventSource 3
interface for connecting generic "event sink" functions to various low-level
event sources (such as file descriptor events, filesystem events,
.Xr AG_Timer 3
expirations, interrupts, etc).
Internally, Agar uses the most efficient system interface available (such as
.Xr kqueue 2
or
.Xr select 2 ) ,
hiding all platform-specific details from the application.
.It
The
.Xr AG_File 3
interface provides filesystem access methods, where filesystems are available.
.It
The
.Xr AG_Db 3
interface provides access to databases of key/value pairs using various
backends (such as "hash", "btree" and "mysql").
.It
The
.Xr AG_User 3
interface provides information about user accounts, where supported.
.It
The
.Xr AG_Net 3
system provides a portable network API.
.It
.Xr AG_String 3
provides C string utility routines.
This includes portable formatted output conversion, portable versions of
.Xr strsep 3 ,
.Xr strlcpy 3 ,
etc.
Character set conversion is also provided by
.Xr AG_ImportUnicode 3
and
.Xr AG_ExportUnicode 3 .
.El
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_InitCore "const char *progname" "Uint flags"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_AtExitFunc "void (*fn)(void)"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_Quit "void"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_Destroy "void"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_InitCore
function initializes the
.Nm
library.
The optional
.Fa progname
argument sets an application name (this name may be used by ag_gui and
.Nm
to set various platform-dependent defaults).
.Fa progname
may be set to NULL.
.Pp
Available
.Fa flags
options include:
.Bl -tag -width "AG_CREATE_DATADIR "
.It AG_VERBOSE
Allow errors/warnings on the standard error output.
.It AG_CREATE_DATADIR
Create a data directory for the application.
The exact location of the directory is platform-dependent (and may
depend on
.Fa progname ) .
For example, on POSIX platforms,
.Pa ~/.<progname>
would be used.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_AtExitFunc
registers a function that will be invoked automatically by
.Fn AG_Destroy .
.Pp
.Fn AG_Quit
terminates the application by releasing resources allocated by
.Nm
and invoking
.Xr exit 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_Destroy
function releases all resources allocated by the
.Nm
library.
.Pp
.Sh AGAR VERSION INFORMATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_GetVersion "AG_AgarVersion *ver"
.Pp
.Ft bool
.Fn AG_VERSION_ATLEAST "int major" "int minor" "int patchlevel"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_GetVersion
function fills an
.Ft AG_AgarVersion
structure with version information:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct ag_agar_version {
	int major;
	int minor;
	int patch;
	const char *release;
} AG_AgarVersion;
.Ed
.Pp
Agar does not need to have been previously initialized for
.Fn AG_GetVersion
to work.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_VERSION_ATLEAST
macro evaluates to true if the current Agar version is equal to, or exceeds
the given version number.

function first appeared in Agar 1.0.
