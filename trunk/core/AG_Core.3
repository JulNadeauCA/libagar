.ds vT Agar API Reference
.ds oS Agar 1.0
.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Core
.Nd agar core library initialization
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar core library (ag_core) implements the base Agar object system
(see
.Xr AG_Object 3 ) .
The ag_core library also provides light, platform-independent interfaces
to filesystems, databases, and other resources.
.Pp
Note that there are no GUI-related functions in ag_core.
The Agar GUI system (the ag_gui library) uses ag_core, but ag_core
can be used in a standalone manner by non-GUI applications.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_InitCore
function should be invoked before any other Agar library call is made.
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_InitCore "const char *progname" "Uint flags"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_AtExitFunc "void (*fn)(void)"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_Quit "void"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_Destroy "void"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_InitCore
function initializes the ag_core library.
The optional
.Fa progname
argument sets an application name (this name may be used by ag_gui and
ag_core to set various platform-dependent defaults).
.Fa progname
may be set to NULL.
.Pp
Available
.Fa flags
options include:
.Bl -tag -width "AG_NO_CFG_AUTOLOAD "
.It AG_VERBOSE
Allow errors/warnings on the standard error output.
.It AG_CREATE_DATADIR
Create a data directory for the application.
The exact location of the directory is platform-dependent and may use
.Fa progname .
For example, under Unix,
.Pa ~/.<progname>
would be used.
.It AG_NO_CFG_AUTOLOAD
If a previously saved
.Xr AG_Config 3
profile exists, don't attempt to load it upon initialization.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_AtExitFunc
registers a function that will be invoked automatically by
.Fn AG_Destroy .
.Pp
.Fn AG_Quit
terminates the application by releasing resources allocated by
ag_core and invoking
.Xr exit 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_Destroy
function releases all resources allocated by the ag_core library.
.Pp
.Sh AGAR VERSION INFORMATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_GetVersion "AG_AgarVersion *ver"
.Pp
.Ft bool
.Fn AG_VERSION_ATLEAST "int major" "int minor" "int patchlevel"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_GetVersion
function fills an
.Ft AG_AgarVersion
structure with version information:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct ag_agar_version {
	int major;
	int minor;
	int patch;
	const char *release;
} AG_AgarVersion;
.Ed
.Pp
Agar does not need to have been previously initialized for
.Fn AG_GetVersion
to work.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_VERSION_ATLEAST
macro evaluates to true if the current Agar version is equal to, or exceeds
the given version number.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr AG_Intro 3 ,
.Xr AG_InitGraphics 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn AG_InitCore
function first appeared in Agar 1.0.
Agar 1.4.0 saw the introduction of
.Xr AG_InitGraphics 3 .
