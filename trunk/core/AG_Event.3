.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Event
.Nd agar event system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface implements a system of virtual functions for purposes of servicing
.Em events ,
on top of
.Xr AG_Object 3 .
Event handler functions are provided with a list of typed arguments.
Execution of event handlers can be delayed for a set amount of time, or marked
for execution in a separate thread where thread support is available.
.Pp
Event processing is triggered by the
.Fn AG_PostEvent
function, which causes the execution the event handler routine(s)
previously registered by
.Fn AG_SetEvent
(or
.Fn AG_AddEvent ) .
Event handlers are declared as:
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.\" NOMANLINK
.Ft void
.Fn MyEventHandler "AG_Event *event"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fa event
structure contains a list of typed
.Em arguments ,
constructed from the arguments provided to
.Fn AG_SetEvent
and
.Fn AG_PostEvent .
The event arguments can be retrieved either by
.Em index
using the
.Fn AG_<TYPE>
macros, or by
.Em name
using with the
.Fn AG_NAMED_<TYPE>
macros.
When retrieving arguments by index, keep in mind that the list of arguments
passed by
.Fn AG_PostEvent
.Em follow
the list of arguments provided by
.Fn AG_SetEvent .
For variable argument counts, the arguments can be retrieved directly from the
.Fa event
structure.
.Pp
The special argument
.Fn AG_SELF
(or
.Fn AG_PTR(0) )
is a pointer to the
.Xr AG_Object 3
receiving the event.
Where applicable,
.Fn AG_SENDER
returns a pointer to the
.Xr AG_Object 3
responsible for raising the event.
.Pp
Note that when Agar is compiled with
.Dv DEBUG ,
the
.Fn AG_<TYPE>
macros provide type checking at runtime.
.Sh EVENT LOOPS
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_EventLoop "void"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The event loop of an Agar application typically waits for events, invokes
GUI rendering routines and processes timer events.
Some applications will use a custom event loop routine, but
.Fn AG_EventLoop
happens to be suitable for most applications where it is necessary to strike
a good balance between accuracy of real-time events and CPU efficiency.
.Fn AG_EventLoop
tries to update the display and process events in the most efficient way for
the underlying graphics system.
Usually, this involves computing delays which will allow a stable refresh
rate to be maintained (see
.Xr AG_SetRefreshRate 3 ) ,
input events to be serviced quickly and timed events (see
.Xr AG_Timeout 3
and
.Fn AG_SchedEvent )
to be executed at accurate points in time.
.Sh EVENT PROCESSING
.nr nS 1
.Ft "AG_Event *"
.Fn AG_SetEvent "AG_Object *obj" "const char *event_name" "void (*handler)(AG_Event *event)" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Fn AG_AddEvent "AG_Object *obj" "const char *event_name" "void (*handler)(AG_Event *event)" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "AG_Event *"
.Fn AG_FindEventHandler "AG_Object *obj" "const char *name"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_UnsetEvent "AG_Object *obj" "const char *event_name"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_PostEvent "AG_Object *sndr" "AG_Object *rcvr" "const char *event_name" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_SchedEvent "AG_Object *sndr" "AG_Object *rcvr" "Uint32 ticks" "const char *event_name" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_ReschedEvent "AG_Object *obj" "const char *event_name" "Uint32 ticks"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_CancelEvent "AG_Object *obj" "const char *event_name"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ForwardEvent "AG_Object *sndr" "AG_Object *rcvr" "AG_Event *event"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_SetEvent
function registers a new event handler to service events of type
.Fa name .
If an event handler is already registered for the given event type, it
is replaced.
The
.Fn AG_AddEvent
variant preserves any existing event handler, such that multiple handlers
can be invoked when the event is raised.
.Pp
If
.Fa name
is NULL, the event handler is not assigned a type, but may be referenced
by the pointer returned by
.Fa AG_SetEvent .
The
.Fa handler
argument specifies the event handler function.
.Pp
The
.Fa fmt
format string and subsequent arguments specify a list of arguments to
insert into the argument vector starting at position 1.
When the event handler function is invoked, it will be passed those
arguments as well as any additional arguments inserted into the argument
vector by
.Fn AG_PostEvent
or
.Fn AG_SchedEvent .
.Pp
The format string in
.Fn AG_PostEvent
and
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
accept the following sequences:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent -width "diouxX "
.It diouxX
Converted to
.Ft int
.It DOU
Converted to
.Ft long int
.It eEfgG
Converted to
.Ft double
.It c
Converted to
.Ft char
.It s
Converted to
.Ft char *
.It p
Converted to
.Ft void *
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_FindEventHandler
function returns any event handler associated with the given event, or NULL
if there are none.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_UnsetEvent
function removes the named event handler from the list.
Any future execution of this event handler as scheduled by
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
will be cancelled.
If this event handler is currently being executed (in the case of a multi-threaded
timing scheme), the function waits for its termination.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PostEvent
function immediately executes the event handler function associated with the given
event type, if there is any.
.Fa fmt
is a format string and the arguments following it are inserted into the argument
vector passed to the event handler (following the arguments registered by
.Fn AG_SetEvent ) .
.Fn AG_PostEvent
returns 1 if an event handler was invoked, or 0 if there is no registered
event handler for the given event type.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
function is similar to
.Fn AG_PostEvent ,
except that the event is scheduled to occur in the given number of ticks
(the meaning of which is specific to the timing scheme).
It is not possible to schedule the execution of the same event handler
multiple times.
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
returns 0 on success or -1 if no matching event handler was found.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ReschedEvent
function reschedules a previously scheduled event of the given name to
execute in the given number of ticks, using the same argument vector.
.Fn AG_ReschedEvent
returns 0 on success or -1 if there was no matching event handler.
.Pp
.Fn AG_CancelEvent
cancels any future execution of a previously scheduled event.
The function returns -1 if no matching event was found, 1 if a scheduled
event was cancelled, or 0 if there was nothing to cancel.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ForwardEvent
function relays the given event to object
.Fa rcvr ,
passing
.Fa sndr
as the sender pointer.
.Sh EVENT FLAGS
Acceptable
.Va flags
for the
.Nm
structure include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "AG_EVENT_PROPAGATE "
.It AG_EVENT_ASYNC
Arrange for the event handler to execute inside a separate thread that will
be automatically created (and managed by the receiver object).
This flag is only available if Agar was compiled with the
.Dv THREADS
option.
.It AG_EVENT_PROPAGATE
Event is to be automatically forwarded to all of the receiver object's
children, recursively.
Unless
.Dv AG_EVENT_ASYNC
events are used, the order of execution is such that the children's event
handler functions are executed prior to the receiver object's.
.It AG_EVENT_SCHEDULED
Event has been previously scheduled for execution by
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
(read-only).
.El
.Sh ARGUMENT MANIPULATION
In some cases it is desirable for functions to accept a list of event handler
arguments like
.Fn AG_SetEvent ,
and possibly manipulate its entries directly.
For example, the
.Xr AG_MenuAction 3
function of the GUI widget
.Xr AG_Menu 3
accepts a pointer to an event handler function, followed by an
.Fn AG_SetEvent
style format string and a variable list of arguments, making the code
more understandable.
.Pp
The following macros provide an interface for manipulating event handler
arguments directly:
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EVENT_INSERT_ARG "AG_Event *ev, va_list ap, MEMBER, TYPE"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EVENT_INSERT_VAL "AG_Event *ev, MEMBER, VALUE"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EVENT_PUSH_ARG "va_list ap, char fmt_char, AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_EVENT_INSERT_ARG
macro inserts an argument at the end of the argument vector for
.Fa ev .
The value to assign is obtained from
.Xr va_arg 3
using the given
.Fa TYPE
argument.
.Fa MEMBER
is the name of the
.Ft "union evarg"
member ("p" = pointer, "s" = string, "i" = int, "li" = long int and "f" = double).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_EVENT_INSERT_VAL
macro also inserts an argument at the end of the argument vector, but
.Fa VALUE
is directly assigned to the given
.Fa MEMBER .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_EVENT_PUSH_ARG
function inserts a new argument onto the argument vector.
The type is obtained from the
.Fa fmt_char
argument which is a character from an
.Fn AG_SetEvent
style format string.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment demonstrates the typical
.Nm
usage in the Agar-GUI library:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

void
SayHello(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *s = AG_STRING(1);    /* Given in AG_SetEvent() */
	int new_state = AG_INT(2); /* Passed by the AG_Button(3) */

	AG_TextMsg(AG_MSG_INFO, "Hello, %s! (state = %d)",
	    s, new_state);
}

AG_Button *btn = AG_ButtonNew(NULL, 0, "Say hello");
AG_SetEvent(btn, "button-pushed", SayHello, "%s", "World");
.Ed
Or alternatively:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AG_ButtonNewFn(NULL, 0, "Say hello", SayHello, "%s", "World");
