.Nm AG_Event
.Nd agar event system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface implements a system of virtual functions for purposes of servicing
.Em events .
An
.Xr AG_Object 3
may act as an event sender, or an event receiver.
Event handler functions are passed a list of zero or more arguments.
Execution of event handlers can be delayed for a set amount of time, or marked
for execution in a separate thread (where thread support is available).
.Pp
Event processing is triggered by the
.Fn AG_PostEvent
function, which causes the execution the event handler routine(s)
previously registered by
.Fn AG_SetEvent
or
.Fn AG_AddEvent .
Event handlers are declared as:
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.\" NOMANLINK
.Ft void
.Fn MyEventHandler "AG_Event *event"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fa event
structure contains the event arguments, which are most convenient retrieved
using macros; see
.Sx EVENT ARGUMENTS
below for details.
.Pp
NOTE: This manual page documents Agar's high-level event processing interface.
For more information on low-level event processing, see
.Xr AG_EventLoop 3 .

.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_SetEvent
function registers a new event handler to service events of type
.Fa name .
If an event handler is already registered for the given event type, it
is replaced.
The
.Fn AG_AddEvent
variant preserves any existing event handler, such that multiple handlers
can be invoked when the event is raised.
The
.Fa fn
argument is a pointer to the event handler function, and
.Fa fnArgs
is a special kind of format string specifying a list of arguments that
should be passed on to the event handler function.
See
.Sx EVENT ARGUMENTS
below for details.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_Set<TYPE>Fn
family of functions create a virtual function with a return value of the
specified TYPE.
By default, virtual functions are unnamed (and referenced by the returned
.Fn AG_Function
handle).
Names can still be assigned to virtual functions by setting the
.Va name
field.
Since event handlers and virtual functions are implemented
identically, the
.Fn AG_Function
type is just an alias for
.Fn AG_Event .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_FindEventHandler
function searches for an event handler by name, returning a pointer to the
.Nm
element on success or NULL if there is no match.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_UnsetEvent
function deletes the named event handler.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PostEvent
function immediately executes the event handler function associated with the
given event type, if there is any.
The
.Fa fn
and
.Fa fnArgs
arguments to
.Fn AG_PostEvent
are interpreted in the same way as
.Fn AG_SetEvent
and
.Fn AG_AddEvent ,
but the arguments are appended at the end of the argument list.
When the event handler function retrieves arguments by index (as opposed to
using argument names), it is important to remember that the arguments to
.Fn AG_PostEvent
follow the arguments given to
.Fn AG_SetEvent
or
.Fn AG_AddEvent .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PostEvent
function returns 1 if an event handler was invoked, or 0 if there is no
registered event handler for the specified event.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PostEventByPtr
variant accepts a pointer to an
.Nm
element, as opposed to looking up the event handler by name.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
function provides an interface similar to
.Fn AG_PostEvent ,
except that the event is scheduled to occur in the given number of ticks
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
returns 0 on success or -1 if the timer could not be created.
If the object is detached or destroyed, all events scheduled for execution
are automatically cancelled.
A more flexible interface for implementing timers is described in
.Xr AG_Timer 3
(which
.Fn AG_SchedEvent
uses internally).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ForwardEvent
function relays the given event to object
.Fa rcvr ,
passing
.Fa sndr
as the sender pointer.
.Sh EVENT ARGUMENTS
The
.Fn AG_SetEvent ,
.Fn AG_AddEvent
and
.Fn AG_PostEvent
routines accept a special
.Fa fnArgs
format string specifying a list of arguments to be passed to the event handler
function.
For example, the
.Sq %s,%p,%i
string specifies that the following arguments are a string, a pointer and an
.Ft int .
The arguments would retrieved by the event handler function like so:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
MyEventHandler(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *s = AG_STRING(1);
	void *p = AG_PTR(2);
	int i = AG_INT(3);
}
.Ed
.Pp
Named arguments are also supported.
For example, the format string
.Sq %s(foo),%p(bar),%i(baz)
specifies string, pointer and integer arguments, which can be retrieved using:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
MyEventHandler(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *s = AG_STRING_NAMED("foo");
	void *p = AG_PTR_NAMED("bar");
	int i = AG_INT_NAMED("baz");
}
.Ed
.Pp
The following argument specifiers are accepted:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "%Cp "
.It "%p"
An arbitrary pointer (void *).
.It "%Cp"
An arbitrary pointer (const void *).
.It "%i"
A signed integer argument (int).
.It "%u"
An unsigned integer argument (Uint).
.It "%li"
A signed long integer argument (long).
.It "%lu"
An unsigned long integer argument (Ulong).
.It "%f"
A real argument (float).
.It "%d"
A real argument (double).
.It "%s"
A string argument (char *).
.It "%Cs"
A string argument (const char *).
.El
.Pp
The following macros allow event handler routines to retrieve the arguments
passed to them.
Variable arguments are supported - in that case, arguments can be retrieved
directly from the
.Fa event
structure (see
.Sx STRUCTURE DATA ) .

.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_SELF
macro (equivalent to AG_PTR(0)) returns a pointer to the
.Xr AG_Object 3
receiving the event (the
.Fa rcvr
argument to
.Fn AG_PostEvent ) .
.Fn AG_SENDER
returns a pointer to the object sending the event (the
.Fa sndr
argument to
.Fn AG_PostEvent ) ,
if there is one.
.Pp
The following macros return a specific item in the list of arguments.
When retrieving arguments by index, keep in mind that the list of arguments
passed by
.Fn AG_PostEvent
.Em follow
the list of arguments provided by
.Fn AG_SetEvent .
If debugging was enabled at compile time, these macros also ensure type
safety.
.Pp
.Fn AG_PTR
returns a pointer, previously passed as a
.Sq %p
argument.
.Pp
.Fn AG_OBJECT
returns a pointer to an
.Xr AG_Object 3
(previously passed as a
.Sq %p
argument).
It differs from
.Fn AG_PTR
in that the object pointer is verified against the specified object class
and a fatal error is raised if runtime type checking is in effect.
.Pp
.Fn AG_STRING
returns a pointer to a string, previously passed as a
.Sq %s
argument.
The event handler is not allowed to modify the string.
.Pp
.Fn AG_INT ,
.Fn AG_UINT ,
.Fn AG_LONG
and
.Fn AG_ULONG
return the specified native integral number, previously passed as a
.Sq %i ,
.Sq %u ,
.Sq %li
or
.Sq %lu
argument respectively.
.Pp
.Fn AG_FLOAT
and
.Fn AG_DOUBLE
return the specified native floating-point number, previously passed as
.Sq %f
or
.Sq %F
argument respectively.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_*_NAMED
macros retrieve the given argument by name instead of by index.
If there is no argument matching the name, a fatal error is raised.
.Sh ARGUMENT MANIPULATION
In some cases it is desirable for functions to accept a list of event handler
arguments like
.Fn AG_SetEvent ,
and possibly manipulate its entries directly.
For example, the
.Xr AG_MenuAction 3
function of the GUI widget
.Xr AG_Menu 3
accepts a pointer to an event handler function, followed by an
.Fn AG_SetEvent
style format string and a variable list of arguments.
The following functions allow such manipulations.
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventInit "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventArgs "AG_Event *ev" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushPointer "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "void *val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushString "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "char *val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushInt "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "int val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushUint "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "Uint val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushLong "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "long val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushULong "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "Ulong val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushFloat "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "float val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPushDouble "AG_Event *ev" "const char *key" "douvle val"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EVENT_PUSH_ARG "va_list ap" "char formatChar" "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_EventPopArgument "AG_Event *ev"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_EventInit
routine initializes an
.Ft AG_Event
structure with no arguments.
.Pp
.Fn AG_EventArgs
initializes
.Fa ev
and also specifies a list of arguments (in the same format as
.Fn AG_SetEvent ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_EventPush*
functions append an argument to the end of the argument list for the specified
.Nm
structure.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_EVENT_PUSH_ARG
macro also insert an argument, except that the type is obtained from
.Fa formatChar ,
assumed to be a character from an
.Fn AG_SetEvent
style format string, and the argument is retrieved using
.Xr va_arg 3 .
.Pp
.Fn AG_EventPopArgument
removes the last argument from the list.
.Sh EVENT QUEUES
Under some circumstances, it is useful to gather
.Ft AG_Event
objects into a simple queue.
For example, a custom event loop routine (see
.Xr AG_EventLoop 3 )
or a low-level Agar driver (see
.Xr AG_Driver 3 )
may gather events from input devices and later process them.
The
.Ft AG_EventQ
structure describes a queue of events:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct ag_event_queue {
	Uint     nEvents;
	AG_Event *events;
} AG_EventQ;
.Ed
.Pp
The following routines operate on the
.Ft AG_EventQ
structure:
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_InitEventQ "AG_EventQ *eq"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_FreeEventQ "AG_EventQ *eq"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_QueueEvent "AG_EventQ *eq" "const char *event_name" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_InitEventQ
function initializes an
.Ft AG_EventQ
structure.
.Fn AG_FreeEventQ
releases all resources allocated under an event queue.
.Pp
.Fn AG_QueueEvent
inserts an event in an event queue structure.
The meaning of
.Fa event_name
as well as the syntax of
.Fa fmt
are identical to.
.Fn AG_PostEvent .
.Sh STRUCTURE DATA
For the
.Ft AG_Event
structure:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "AG_Variable *argv "
.It Ft char * name
String identifier for the event.
.It Ft Uint flags
See
.Sx EVENT FLAGS
section below.
.It Ft int argc
Argument count.
.It Ft AG_Variable *argv
Argument data (see
.Xr AG_Variable 3 ) .
.El
.Sh EVENT FLAGS
Acceptable
.Va flags
for the
.Nm
structure include:
.Bl -tag -width "AG_EVENT_PROPAGATE "
.It AG_EVENT_ASYNC
Arrange for the event handler to execute inside a separate thread that will
be automatically created (and managed by the receiver object).
This flag is only available if Agar was compiled with the
.Dv AG_THREADS
option.
.It AG_EVENT_PROPAGATE
Automatically forward events of this type to all attached child objects.
If
.Dv AG_EVENT_ASYNC
is also set, the event handlers of the child objects are executed concurrently.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment demonstrates a typical
.Nm
usage in the Agar-GUI library.
We bind an action to the button press event, which is called
.Sq button-pushed .
This event is documented in the
.Xr AG_Button 3
manual, and so are the arguments it appends to the list of arguments passed
to the event handler (in this case, a single
.Ft int ) .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
SayHello(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *s = AG_STRING(1);    /* Given in AG_SetEvent() */
	int new_state = AG_INT(2); /* Passed by 'button-pushed',
	                              see AG_Button(3) */

	AG_TextMsg(AG_MSG_INFO, "Hello, %s! (state = %d)",
	    s, new_state);
}

AG_Button *btn = AG_ButtonNew(NULL, 0, "Say hello");
AG_SetEvent(btn, "button-pushed", SayHello, "%s", "World");
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ft AG_Button
API provides a shorthand constructor routine,
.Fn AG_ButtonNewFn ,
which accepts the
.Sq button-pushed
event handler as argument:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AG_ButtonNewFn(NULL, 0, "Say hello", SayHello, "%s", "World");
.Ed
.Pp
The following code fragment is equivalent:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AG_Button *btn = AG_ButtonNew(NULL, 0, "Say hello");
AG_Event *event = AG_SetEvent(btn, "button-pushed", SayHello, NULL);
AG_EventPushString(event, NULL, "World");
.Ed
.Pp
The following code fragment invokes a handler routine artificially:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
SayHello(AG_Event *event)
{
	char *foostring = AG_STRING(1);
	int fooint = AG_INT(2);
}

AG_Event event;
AG_EventArgs(&event, "%s,%d", "Foo string", 1234);
SayHello(&event);
