.El
.Sh AGAR-SG
.Pp
Agar-SG is a generic 3D geometry and graphics rendering engine.
Given an input of geometrical and scene information, Agar-SG is designed
to provide efficient space partitioning, high-quality rendering from any
viewpoint and generic solving of geometrical constraints between entities.
