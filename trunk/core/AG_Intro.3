.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Intro
.Nd agar introduction
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Agar is a graphical application toolkit.
It provides all types of graphical applications, written in different languages,
with consistent interfaces across a wide array of platforms.
.Pp
This document summarizes the various interfaces provided by the standard
libraries included in the official Agar source distribution (such as
.Em ag_core ,
.Em ag_gui ,
etc.)
These libraries share the same version number and release cycle, but they are
separate and can be packaged and distributed independently.
.Sh USING THE AGAR API REFERENCE
The Agar API Reference is intended as a detailed specification explaining
Agar's functions and structures in sufficient detail.
To avoid the content becoming repetitive, the API Reference uses a number
of important conventions regarding error handling and thread-safety:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The return value for functions returning
.Ft int ,
unless otherwise documented, represents an error code, where 0 indicates
success and -1 indicates failure.
On failure, an error message string can be retrieved using
.Xr AG_GetError 3 .
.It
Some functions have variants differing only in argument format.
For example,
.Xr AG_LabelNew 3
accepts a format string, and
.Xr AG_LabelNewS 3
accepts a plain C string.
Since the difference is shown in function prototype, it is customary to omit
mentioning those variants in the following paragraph describing the function.
.It
Some functions have variants differing only in error-handling style.
Those may also be omitted from the description paragraph.
For example,
.Xr AG_MutexInit 3
has no return value.
If the function fails, an
.Xr AG_FatalError 3
is raised.
The
.Xr AG_MutexTryInit
variant, however, returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.
.It
When Agar is compiled with threads support, Agar functions are thread-safe
(free-threaded), unless documented otherwise (see
.Dq CONVENTIONS
section of
.Xr AG_Threads 3
for important details related to thread safety).
.El
.Pp
There is generally one manual page per Agar object class.
A number of manual page sections are standard throughout the documentation,
this includes:
.Bl -tag -width "INHERITANCE HIERARCHY "
.It INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
List of parent (inherited) classes.
See
.Xr AG_Object 3
for details on inheritance with the Agar object system.
.It EVENTS
List of events defined by this object (and optionally, a list
of events potentially raised by this object).
See
.Xr AG_Event 3
for details on Agar events.
.It STRUCTURE DATA
List of public structure members which are safe to access directly (in the
specified way).
Multithreaded applications must use
.Xr AG_ObjectLock 3
prior to accessing this data (although in some contexts, such as inside event
handler routines, objects can be presumed locked; see
.Xr AG_Threads 3
for details).
.El
.Sh AGAR-CORE
Agar's general utility library is named
.Em ag_core .
It implements the
.Xr AG_Object 3
object system which is used extensively by all other Agar libraries.
It also provides cross-platform interfaces to operating system services
(e.g., filesystems, network services, threads).
.Pp
To use this library, link against
.Sq agar-config --libs
(non-graphical applications can also link against
.Sq agar-core-config --libs
to avoid the GUI library).

performance and efficiency achievable with any given graphics system.

.El
.Sh AGAR-VG
The
.Em ag_vg
library is a simple 2D vector graphics library which allows developers
to specify hierarchical sketches consisting of elements such as lines, curves
and text.
It uses linear transformations to define the placement of geometrical
entities, which the best approach for most applications.
.Pp
Following the same design philosophy as the Agar-GUI,
.Em ag_vg
only provides the
entity classes (e.g., lines, arcs) useful to the widest range of applications,
and allows specialized and application-specific entities to be implemented
easily in separate libraries.
For specialized applications such as CAD systems, the placement of entities
might be best described through geometrical constraints (e.g., distances and
angles) as opposed to linear transformations.
This functionality is implemented, notably, by
.Lk http://freesg.org/ the FreeSG library .
.Pp
To use this library, link against
.Sq agar-vg-config --libs .

.Sh AGAR-MATH

complex-number/quaternion routines and some useful Agar-GUI widgets and
extensions.
