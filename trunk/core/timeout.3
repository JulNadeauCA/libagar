.Sh NAME
.Nm timeout
.Nd agar timer facility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/timeout.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
subsystem manages the scheduling and execution of specific callback functions
at specific points in real-time or simulated real-time.
A callback function has the prototype:
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.\" NOMANLINK
.Ft "Uint32"
.Fn fn "void *obj" "Uint32 ival" "void *arg"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
Where
.Fa obj
is a pointer to the object managing the timeout (or NULL),
.Fa ival
is the delay in ticks before the next invocation, and
.Fa arg
is the user-supplied pointer passed to
.Fn timer_add .
If the callback function returns a non-zero value, the timeout is automatically
rescheduled to occur in t+n ticks.
.Pp
The
.Xr event 3
interface uses
.Nm
internally to implement timing-related events (registered using
.Fn AG_SchedEvent ) .
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_SetTimeout "AG_Timeout *to" "Uint32 (*fn)(void *obj, Uint32 ival, void *arg)" "void *arg, int flags"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_AddTimeout "void *obj" "AG_Timeout *to" "Uint32 ival"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ReplaceTimeout "void *obj" "AG_Timeout *to" "Uint32 ival"
.Pp

.Fn AG_DelTimeout "void *obj" "AG_Timeout *to"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_TimeoutIsScheduled "void *obj" "AG_Timeout *to"
.Pp

.Fn AG_LockTimeouts "void *obj"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_UnlockTimeouts "void *obj"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SetTimeout
function initializes a pre-allocated
.Nm
structure using the specified callback function and argument.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
may contain:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define AG_TIMEOUT_DETACHABLE	0x01  /* Don't cancel in AG_ObjectDetach() */
#define AG_TIMEOUT_LOADABLE	0x02  /* Don't cancel in AG_ObjectLoad() */
.Ed
.Pp
Flags
.Dv AG_TIMEOUT_DETACHABLE
and
.Dv AG_TIMEOUT_LOADABLE
indicate that
.Fn AG_ObjectDetach
and
.Fn AG_ObjectLoad ,
respectively, should not cancel scheduled executions of this timeout.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_AddTimeout
function schedules the previously specified callback function for execution in
t+ival ticks.
The
.Fa obj
argument specifies the
.Xr AG_Object 3
which is responsible for the scheduling and execution of the given callback
function.
.Pp
Different types of objects may implement different timing schemes involving
either real-time or simulated real-time.
If the
.Fa obj
argument is NULL, the callback is not associated with any object and a
default timing scheme is used.
.Pp
With the default timing scheme, a
.Dq tick
is considered to be equivalent to 1 millisecond (as obtained from
.Xr SDL_GetTicks 3 ) .
Different timing schemes may assign different meanings to one tick, for
example a digital simulation could define one tick to be equivalent to
one nanosecond, and the timing scheme could be made to allow single-stepping.
On a multiprocessor system, one might consider a multithreaded timing scheme.
The
.Nm
interface remains consistent across different timing schemes.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ReplaceTimeout
function is a variant of
.Fn AG_AddTimeout
which invokes
.Fn AG_DelTimeout
implicitly, prior to scheduling the event.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_DelTimeout
function removes the given timeout from the queue if it is currently scheduled
for execution.
.Fn timeout_exists
returns 1 if the given timeout is currently in the queue.
.Pp
Both
.Fn AG_AddTimeout
and
.Fn AG_DelTimeout
may be invoked safely from callback functions, but it is more efficient to use
the callback's return value for rescheduling or cancelling timeouts.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_TimeoutIsScheduled
function returns 1 if the given timeout is scheduled for execution, otherwise
it returns 0.
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface is thread-safe, but it is important to use
.Fn AG_LockTimeouts
and
.Fn AG_UnlockTimeouts
in constructions such as:
.Bd -literal
AG_LockTimeouts(obj);
if (AG_TimeoutIsScheduled(obj, &timeout)) {
	AG_DelTimeout(obj, &timeout);
}
AG_UnlockTimeouts(obj);
.Ed
.Sh CANCELLATION
Whenever an
.Xr AG_Object 3
controlling timeouts is about to be detached,
.Fn AG_ObjectDetach
cancels any scheduled timeout.
This behavior can be avoided by setting the
.Dv AG_TIMEOUT_DETACHABLE
flag.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ObjectLoad
function also cancels scheduled timeouts, unless the
.Dv AG_TIMEOUT_LOADABLE
flag is given.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ObjectDestroy
always cancels every scheduled timeout.
.Pp
With a multithreaded timing scheme, cancelling a timeout might imply waiting
for the termination of a thread (possibly sending it a signal as well).
.Sh TROUBLETONS
The flags
.Dv AG_TIMEOUT_DETACHABLE
.Dv AG_TIMEOUT_LOADABLE
have confusing names.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
facility first appeared in Agar 1.0.
The interface was inspired by the OpenBSD
.Xr timeout 9
API designed by Artur Grabowski and Thomas Nordin.
The prototype for callbacks is inspired from SDL by Sam Lantinga.
The implementation uses the algorithms presented by George Varghese and
Tony Lauck.
