 * General-purpose tree structure (not to confuse with binary trees as in

 *
 * Compared to the AG_Queue(3) macro package, using this interface to
 * implement a tree structure has the advantage of the tree being directly
 * traversable (e.g., by a GUI widget such as AG_TreeView(3)), in a generic
 * fashion. However, this comes at the cost of an extra level of indirection
