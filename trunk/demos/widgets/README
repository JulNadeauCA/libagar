This application displays a couple of Agar-GUI widgets. It is useful for
testing new themes (see AG_Style(3)), but it does not demonstrate widget
functionality in any useful way. If you have libjpeg installed, F8 will
generate a screenshot. Some command-line options are provided:

	-v			Display Agar version/release and exit
	-g			Force OpenGL graphics driver
	-s			Force SDL graphics driver
	-w [width]		Display width in pixels
	-h [height] 		Display height in pixels
	-f			Force full screen mode
	-r [fps]		Set fixed refresh rate
	-b			Force use of FreeType font engine
	-B			Force use of bitmap font engine
	-T [dir]		Set font loading directory
	-t [face,pts,flags]	Load an alternate font as default
	                        (accepted flags include 'b'=bold,
				'i'=italic and 'U'=uppercase)
	-d			Instead of the stock event loop, enable
	                        double buffering and use a custom event
				loop which uses SDL_Flip().
	-R			When using windowed graphics drivers,
	                        don't request that the display window
				be resizable.
