.c1 "Overview"
.pp
\fBAgar\fP originally started in early 2002 as a free ("open source") engine for
an 2D/tile-based role-playing game, \fITrek to the Cave\fP.
One of the major design goals of Agar was the ability to maintain a large,
fully persistent world, but still use memory efficiently.
.pp
The \fBAgar Engine\fP was since adapted to suit many more types of applications,
including simulations, video edition and scientific applications.
This was not the author's original intention, rather a consequence of his
pursuit for a clean and general design.
As the \fITrek to the Cave\fP level editor was constantly in the need for
a more sophisticated user interface, aa window system and a set of
\fIwidgets\fP were also developed.
.c2 "Requirements"
.pp
Agar is written in ANSI C (\fIANSI X3.159-1989\fP), and requires the
SDL cross-platform multimedia library, available from
.Ur http://www.libsdl.org/ .
Thread safety is only available for \fIPOSIX Threads\fP implementations that
include support for mutexes of the recursive type, as required by the
Version 2 of the \fISingle Unix Specification\fP (\fISUSv2\fP).

.c2 "Agar Availability"
.pp
The latest version of Agar is available from
.Ur http://agar.csoft.org/ .
At the time of this writing, Agar has been successfully tested under the
\fIOpenBSD\fP, \fINetBSD\fP, \fIFreeBSD\fP, \fILinux\fP and
\fISGI\(rg IRIX\(rg\fP operating systems, but
it is expected to run on all platforms supported by SDL.
