.c1 "The .den archive format"
.lp
Agar stores multimedia data in
.Xr den 5
archives.
Agar's build system compiles files in various formats into an archive file
(with the
.Pa den
suffix), using the
.Xr dencomp 1
utility.
.c2 "Typical Makefile for a .den archive"
.lp
A typical
.Pa Makefile
for a \fIden\fP archive may look like the following.
The
.Xr dencomp 1
utility may also be invoked manually.
As the
.Xr den 5
archive format was designed to allow language-specific overrides, each
archive entry includes an optional ISO 639 language code.
In addition to
.Xr dencomp 1 ,
the Agar distribution comes with an utility to extract archive members,
.Xr denex 1 .
