.Sh NAME
.Nm agar
.Nd game engine
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an object-oriented graphical game engine.
.Sh LOCKING CONSTRAINTS
The engine defines macros around pthread locking calls, to catch errors,
or to nullify them if thread safety has been disabled at compile-time.
.Pp
Locking constraints must be clearly commented at the beginning of each
function, whether it is assumed that a non-recursive lock is held, or
whether the calling thread must not hold a non-recursive lock.
.Pp
Every subsystem must hide locking constraints from the other subsystems
by providing a well-defined interface.
.Pp
The
.Va world->lock
mutex protects the existence of objects.
To avoid a race inside the async event handler, between entry and acquisition
of
.Va world->lock
(where another thread may be able to detach the object before the lock is
acquired), async event handlers must ensure that the object still exists
in the
.Va world->objs
list once the
.Va world->lock
mutex is acquired.
