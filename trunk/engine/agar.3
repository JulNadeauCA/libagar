.Sh NAME
.Nm agar
.Nd graphical C application framework
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a high-level, cross-platform C application framework aimed primarly at
2D/3D games and simulations.
.Sh OBJECT DESIGN
.Nm
games/simulations are built around a tree of
.Xr object 3
structures whose state is persistent.
For instance, the initial hierarchy of objects of a game is initially built by
level designers and the state is saved to files which are distributed with
the game binary (which is essentially an interpreter).
As the game progresses, the player modifies the objects and they are saved
to disk.
.Sh INCLUDE FILES

.Pa Aq engine/compat/*.h

.Pa Aq config/*.h
