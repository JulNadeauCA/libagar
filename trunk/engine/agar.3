.Sh NAME
.Nm agar
.Nd game engine
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an object-oriented graphical game engine.
.Sh LOCKING CONSTRAINTS
The engine defines macros around pthread locking calls, to catch errors.
.Pp
Locking constraints must be clearly commented at the beginning of each
function, whether it is assumed that a lock is held, or whether the
calling thread must not hold a lock.
Recursive mutex locks are not worth mentioning.
.Pp
Every subsystem must hide locking constraints from the other subsystems
by providing a well-defined interface.
.Sh OBJECT EXISTENCE PROTECTION
.Bl -bullet -width 4n
The global, recursive mutex
.Va world->lock ,
protects the game object list.
.It
Since the rendering routines must frequently lock the object list when
resolving
.Xr map 3
node references, the object list
.Va world->wobjs
and the object count
.Va world->nobjs
are visible to high-level code, and protected by the
.Va world->lock
mutex.
.It
The
.Va world->lock
mutex protects the existence of objects.
To avoid a race inside the async event handler, between entry and acquisition
of
.Va world->lock
(where another thread may be able to detach the object before the lock is
acquired), async event handlers must ensure that the object still exists
in the
.Va world->objs
list once the
.Va world->lock
mutex is acquired.
