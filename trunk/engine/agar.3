.Sh NAME
.Nm agar
.Nd game engine
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a thread-safe, object-oriented graphical game engine.
Many of the structures it defines are derived from the
.Xr object 3
structure, which provides pointers to generic data, such as audio, graphics,
properties and an
.Xr event 3
handler list.
The
.Xr event 3
framework implements the passing of events between objects.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "version(3)" -compact
.It Xr map 3
Game levels.
.It Xr perso 3
Game characters.
.It Xr physics 3
Simple movement.
.It Xr version 3
Signatures and versioning of data in network format.
.It Xr view 3
Graphic engine.
.It Xr rootmap 3
Map display used in
.Sq game
mode.
.It Xr world 3
Generic container for objects used in the game.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
implements its own
.Xr window 3
system and
.Xr widget 3
framework.
.Sh THREAD SAFETY
The
.Nm
engine can work with the pthread calls removed at compile time.
.Nm
uses the following locking primitives:
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Simple mutexes.
.It
Recursive mutexes.
.It
Read-write locks.
.El
.Pp
Public
.Nm
interfaces must hide locking from the calling code, as long as there is
no relative impact on performance.
