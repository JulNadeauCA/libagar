.Sh NAME
.Nm char
.Nd AGAR character implementation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <engine/char.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The character structure represents a character occupying a single node
on one map.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Current level and exp
.It
Current anx maximal HP/MP
.It
Status ailments (regen, poison, ...)
.It
Flags (focused, dash, ...)
.It
Directional/speed information
.El
.Sh ENGINE
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct char *"
.Fn char_create "char *name" "char *descr" "int maxhp" "int maxmp" "int flags"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn char_link "void *obj"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn char_destroy "void *obj"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Pp
.Fn char_create
allocates a new character structure. 
Once it is in a consistent state, a call to
.Fn char_link
is made so the character can start handling time (and events, if the
character is focused).
A character is destroyed and unlinked from all maps with a call to
.Fn char_destroy .
.Fn char_event
delivers a SDL event to the character layer, it is called either
directly from the engine or from a particular character implementation.
Meaningful events include:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
SDL_JOYAXISMOTION
.It
SDL_JOYBUTTONDOWN
.It
SDL_JOYBUTTONUP
.It
SDL_KEYDOWN
.It
SDL_KEYUP

.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn char_setanim "struct character *ch" "int aoffs"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Pp
.Fn char_setspeed
readjusts the character's timer.
The
.Fa speed
argument should be something between 0 and the character's maxspeed.
The display's refresh rate will be added to this interval.
.Pp
.Fn char_add
positions the character
.Fa ch
on
.Fa map
at the given coordinates, and
.Fn char_del
removes any reference to
.Fa ch
at the given coordinates.
.Fn char_canmove
returns 0 if the character is able to move to new coordinates
on the current map.
.Fn char_move
moves the character
.Fa ch
to new coordinates on the current map.
.Fn char_setsprite
sets the active sprite, and
.Fn char_setanim
sets the active animation.
