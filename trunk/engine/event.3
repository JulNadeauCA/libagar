.Dt EVENT 3
.Os
.ds vT Agar API Reference
.ds oS Agar 1.0
.Sh NAME
.Nm event
.Nd agar event system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/event.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr object 3
structure contains a list of
.Nm
structures, which associate specific types of events to event handling
functions, and stores a list of arguments.
.Pp
The prototype for event handler functions looks like this:
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn foo "int argc" "union evarg *argv"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fa argv
argument is a pointer to an array of
.Fa argc
unions, defined as:
.Bd -literal
typedef union evarg {
	void	*p;
	char	*s;
	char	 c;
	int	 i;
	long int li;
	double	 f;
} *evargs;
.Ed
.Pp
.Va argv[0]
always points to the
.Xr object 3
which is the receiver of the event.
.Va argv[argc]
always points to the
.Xr object 3
which is the sender of the event (or NULL).
.Pp
The
.Nm
subsystem also implements the
.Sq main loop
used by Agar applications, which performs the following operations:
.Bl -tag -width "Event processing"
.It Video updates
The display is updated when a counter exceeds a fixed amount of ticks, obtained
from
.Xr SDL_GetTicks 3 .
The time it took for the frame to render is taken in consideration as the
refresh rate is recalculated, so animations do not vary in speed, for instance.
Video updates have precedence in the event loop.
.Pp
If the frame was too complicated to draw in one cycle, the minimum delay is
decremented down to the minimum set by
.Xr view_set_refresh 3 .
This can be avoided by lowering the frame rate to ensure that the frame is
rendered in one cycle, or reducing the amount of time spent in rendering
routines.
If the last frame was drawn in a reasonable amount of time, the event loop
calls
.Xr SDL_Delay 3
to relinquish the CPU (taking into account the approximative
.Xr SDL_Delay 3
granularity).
.It Event processing
SDL events are translated to
.Nm
structures, which are sent to the relevant subsystems.
.El
.Sh EVENT PROCESSING
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct event *"
.Fn event_new "void *obj, const char *name" "void (*handler)(int argc, union evarg *argv), const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn event_remove "void *obj", "const char *name"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn event_post "void *sndr, void *rcvr, const char *name, const char *fmt" \
              "..."
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn event_forward "void *rcvr" "const char *name" "int argc" "union evarg *argv"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn event_new
function registers a new event handler to service events of type
.Fa name .
.Fa obj
will be passed as the first argument to the event handler function.
.Fa handler
points to the event-handling function.
.Fa fmt
is a format string and the arguments following it are inserted at the start of
the
.Fa evarg
array, followed by the arguments to
.Fn event_post .
.Pp
The following sequences are valid in
.Fa fmt :
.Bl -tag -compact -width "diouxX"
.It diouxX
Converted to
.Ft int
.It DOU
Converted to
.Ft long int
.It eEfgG
Converted to
.Ft double
.It c
Converted to
.Ft char
.It s
Converted to
.Ft char *
.It p
Converted to
.Ft void *
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn event_remove
function unregisters the named event handler.
.Pp
The
.Fn event_post
function arranges for the event handler associated with
.Fa name ,
if any, to be invoked.
.Fa fmt
is a format string and the arguments following it are inserted
after the arguments registered by
.Fn event_new
in the
.Fa evarg
array.
.Fn event_post
returns 1 if an event handler was invoked, otherwise 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn event_forward
function forwards the event identified by
.Fa name
to object
.Fa obj .
.Fn event_forward
is usually called from an event handler, but may also be used to send
.Sq fake
events, as an alternative to the
.Fn event_post
interface.
.Sh EVENT FLAGS
.Pp
Acceptable flags for the
.Nm
structure include:
.Bd -literal
#define	EVENT_ASYNC		0x01	/* Event handler runs in own thread */
#define EVENT_FORWARD_CHILDREN	0x02	/* Forward to all descendents */
.Ed
.Pp
.Dv EVENT_ASYNC
arranges for the event handler to execute inside a separate thread.
This flag is only available if Agar was compiled with the
.Dv THREADS
option.
.Pp
If the
.Dv EVENT_FORWARD_CHILDREN
flag is set, the event is automatically forwarded to each of the receiver's
children prior to the execution of the event handler.

.Xr object 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
layer first appeared in Agar 1.0
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fa argc
argument to event handlers is seldom useful.
