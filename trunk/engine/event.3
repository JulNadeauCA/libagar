.Os
.ds vT Agar API Reference
.ds oS Agar 1.0
.Sh NAME
.Nm event
.Nd agar event system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/event.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Agar implements generic events using a list of event handlers inside
.Xr object 3
structures.
The
.Nm
subsystem also implements the
.Sq main loop
used by Agar applications, which performs the following operations:
.Bl -tag -width "Event processing"
.It Video updates
The display is updated when a counter exceeds a fixed amount of ticks, obtained
from
.Xr SDL_GetTicks 3 .
The time it took for the frame to render is taken in consideration as the
refresh rate is recalculated, so animations do not vary in speed, for instance.
Video updates have precedence in the event loop.
.Pp
If the frame was too complicated to draw in one cycle, the minimum delay is
decremented down to the minimum set by
.Xr view_set_refresh 3 .
This can be avoided by lowering the frame rate to ensure that the frame is
rendered in one cycle, or reducing the amount of time spent in rendering
routines.
If the last frame was drawn in a reasonable amount of time, the event loop
calls
.Xr SDL_Delay 3
to relinquish the CPU (taking into account the approximative
.Xr SDL_Delay 3
granularity).
.It Event processing
SDL events are translated to
.Nm
structures, which are sent to the relevant subsystems.
.El
.Sh EVENT HANDLERS
Event handlers are referenced by NUL-terminated strings.
Event handler arguments are described by an array of unions:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
typedef union evarg {
	void	*p;
	char	*s;
	char	 c;
	int	 i;
	long int li;
	double	 f;
} *evargs;
.Ed
.Pp
Note that floating-point arguments are only available with the
.Dv FLOATING_POINT
option defined at compile-time.
.Sh EVENT PROCESSING
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct event *"
.Fn event_new "void *obj" "const char *name" "void (*handler)(int argc, union evarg *argv)" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn event_post "void *obj" "const char *name" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn event_forward "void *obj" "const char *name" "int argc" "union evarg *argv"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn event_new
function registers a new event handler to service events called
.Fa name .
.Fa obj
will be passed as the first argument to the event handler function.
.Fa handler
points to the event-handling function.
The
.Fa fmt
argument is a
.Xr printf 3
style format string.
The following arguments will be inserted at the start of the evarg array.
.Pp
The
.Fn event_post
function arranges for the event handler associated with
.Fa name ,
if any, to be invoked.
For events of type
.Dv EVENT_ASYNC ,
a new thread is created in order to service the event (assuming that the
.Dv THREADS
compile-time option was enabled).
The
.Fa fmt
argument is a
.Xr printf 3
like format string.
The arguments following
.Fa fmt
will be inserted at the end of the evarg array.
.Pp
The
.Fn event_forward
function forwards the event identified by
.Fa name
to object
.Fa obj .
.Fn event_forward
is usually called from an event handler, but may also be used to send
.Sq fake
events, as an alternative to the
.Fn event_post
interface.
