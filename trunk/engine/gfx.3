.Sh NAME
.Nm gfx
.Nd agar graphic resource management
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/engine.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar
.Nm
structure represents a set of static and animated graphical surfaces.
Two types of entries are possible:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "GFX_PRIVATE "
.It GFX_SHARED
The graphical elements of this set are a shared resource.
Sets of this type are loaded in memory and garbage collected internally using
reference counting.
.It GFX_PRIVATE
The graphical elements of this set are a private resource, and the task of
managing them is left to an
.Xr object 3 .
.El
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn gfx_init "struct gfx *gfx" "int type" "const char *key"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn gfx_destroy "struct gfx *gfx"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn gfx_init
function initializes a
.Nm
structure of the given
.Fa type
(either
.Dv GFX_SHARED
or
.Dv GFX_PRIVATE ) .
.Fn gfx_destroy
frees the resources allocated by the structure.
.Sh SHARED GRAPHICS
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct gfx *"
.Fn gfx_fetch_shd "const char *key"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn gfx_unused "struct gfx *gfx"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn gfx_fetch_shd
function looks up the table of resident
.Nm
entries for one matching the given
.Fa key .
If a match is found, the function returns a pointer to it and increments its
reference count, otherwise it returns NULL.
.Pp
Once the caller no longer needs to access the graphic elements of the entry,
it should invoke the
.Fn gfx_unused
function, which decrements the reference count of the entry and frees it if
the count reaches 0.
.Sh PRIVATE GRAPHICS
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct gfx *"
.Fn gfx_alloc_pvt "void *obj" "const char *key"
.Pp
.Ft "Uint32"
.Fn gfx_insert_sprite "struct gfx *gfx" "SDL_Surface *surface"
.Pp
.Ft "struct map *"
.Fn gfx_insert_fragments "struct gfx *gfx" "SDL_Surface *surface"
.Pp
.Ft "Uint32"
.Fn gfx_insert_submap "struct gfx *gfx" "struct map *map"
.Pp
.Ft "struct gfx_anim *"
.Fn gfx_insert_anim "struct gfx *gfx"
.Pp
.Ft "Uint32"
.Fn gfx_insert_anim_frame "struct gfx_anim *anim" "SDL_Surface *surface"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn gfx_alloc_pvt
function allocates a private
.Nm
structure for use by the given object.
Typically, the graphical elements for entries of this type are generated by
the object and registered using
.Fn gfx_insert_* .
.Pp
.Fn gfx_insert_sprite
registers a single surface.
.Fn gfx_insert_fragments
breaks a surface into square fragments of size
.Dv TILESZ ,
and returns a
.Xr map 3
describing the fragments.
Such generated maps are registered with
.Fn gfx_insert_submap .
.Pp
The
.Fn gfx_insert_anim
function allocates a new animation structure.
.Fn gfx_insert_anim_frame
puts the given surface on the frame list.

.Xr object 3

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
structure first appeared in Agar 1.0
