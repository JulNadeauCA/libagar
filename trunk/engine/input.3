.Sh NAME
.Nm input
.Nd agar input device interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/input.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
structure is used internally by the
.Xr event 3
and
.Xr object 3
subsystems to represent input devices bound to
.Xr object 3
positions, allowing players to control characters, for instance.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn input_register "void *p, enum input_type type, const char *name" \
                   "const struct input_driver *drv"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn input_deregister "void *p"
.Pp
.Ft "struct input *"
.Fn input_find "const char *name"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn input_destroy "void"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn input_register
function initializes and a attaches a new input device of the given type.
.Fa name
is used to reference the input device in
.Xr object 3
saves.
.Pp
The
.Fn input_deregister
function destroys the given input device.
.Pp
The
.Fn input_find
function looks for the named input device and returns a pointer to it,
or NULL if there is no such device attached.
.Pp
The
.Fn input_destroy
function frees all currently attached input devices.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr event 3 ,

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in Agar 1.0
