.Sh NAME
.Nm den
.Nd agar den archive format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file format has been designed to encapsulate data (such as graphics or audio),
with support for language-specific overrides and searching facilities.
.Pp
Integers are stored in network format, strings are length-encoded.
A
.Nm
archive starts with the
.Sq agar den
string, followed by a 64-bit version code and
a
.Nm
header, which looks like:
.Bd -literal
struct den {
	char	 hint[DEN_HINT_MAX];	/* Hint on type of content */
	char	 name[DEN_NAME_MAX];	/* Name of the package */
	char	*author;		/* Author of the contents */
	char	*copyright;		/* Copyright notice */
	char	*descr;			/* Description of contents */
	char	*keywords;		/* Comma-separated keywords */

	struct den_member *members;
	Uint32		  nmembers;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va hint
field gives a hint about the type of contents, and is only for searching
purposes.
The
.Va name
is an identifier for the whole archive.
.Pp
The
.Va author ,
.Va copyright ,
.Va descr
are optional.
.Va keywords
is provided for searching purposes.
.Pp
The
.Va members
table describes the contents of the archive.
Each element, in its encoded form, looks like:
.Bd -literal
struct den_member {
	Uint32	 name_len;
	char	 name[DEN_MEMBER_NAME_MAX];	/* Identifier */
	Uint32	 lang_len;
	char	 lang[DEN_MEMBER_LANG_MAX];	/* ISO 639 language code */
	Uint32	 offs;				/* Position in archive */
	Uint32	 size;				/* Size in bytes */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va name
string identifies this archive member.
.Va lang
is an ISO 639 language code, or a null string to indicate that this member
contains no language-specific data.
The loader chooses which member to read depending on language preferences.
