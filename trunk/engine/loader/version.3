.Sh NAME
.Nm version
.Nd agar data file versioning
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/loader/version.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
interface encodes, or verifies the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct version {
	char	*name;			/* Signature */
	Uint32	 vermaj, vermin;	/* Version */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Dv vermaj
member is incremented whenever a change introduces binary incompatibility
with previous versions of the data files.
This is usually avoided by comparing versions when loading, and using padding
when saving.
.Pp
The
.Dv vermin
member is incremented whenever a change is made in the data file, but binary
compatibility is preserved.
.Sh VERSIONING
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn version_read "struct netbuf *buf" "const struct version *ver" "struct version *rver"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn version_write "struct netbuf *buf" "const struct version *ver"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn version_read
function reads version information from
.Fa fd
and returns 0 if the following data is binary compatible against the version
represented by
.Fa ver ,
or -1 if the data is not compatible.
If
.Fa rver
is not NULL, it is initialized with the version information read from
.Fa fd .
.Pp
The
.Fn version_write
function writes version information from the structure
.Fa ver
to
.Fa buf .

.Xr agar 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in Agar 1.0
