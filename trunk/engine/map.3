.Sh NAME
.Nm map
.Nd AGAR map implementation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <engine/map.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The map structure maintains a set of tiles, each containing various
flags and a linked list of references. Those references contain:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
A pointer to an object.
.It
An offset within this object.
.It
Flags (saveable, sprite, anim, warp).
.It
Extra animation data (frame#, delay).

.Fn map_create
allocates, and optionally initializes a map with contents from a file.
If
.Fa path
is non-NULL, the description, flags and geometry arguments can be NULL
or -1.
.Fn map_focus
displays a map and start animations.
.Fn map_unfocus
disables animations.
.Fn map_clean
initializes the entire map with an arbitrary reference.

.Pp
The
.Fn MAP_ADDSPRITE
and
.Fn MAP_ADDANIM
macros add an animation reference for
.Fa offs
in
.Fa obj
to the map entry at the given
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
coordinates within the
.Fa map .
.Fn MAP_DELREF
removes any reference to
.Fa offs
in
.Fa obj
within the
.Fa map ,
or any reference to
.Fa obj
if
.Fa offs
is negative.
.Pp
.Fn map_entry_addref
and
.Fn map_entry_delref
manipulate the reference stack on a given map entry.
.Fn map_entry_aref
returns the referece at a given layer, and
.Fn map_entry_arefobj
returns the reference matching an object:offset pair.
