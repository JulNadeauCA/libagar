.Sh NAME
.Nm map
.Nd agar tile-based levels
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <engine/map.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Agar levels are described by a two-dimensional array of nodes; each node holds
a stack of node
.Sq elements .
.Pp
In a game scenario, for instance, the rendering of a scene might be achieved by
blitting the graphical elements in the vicinity in a specific order, while
the audio system mixes samples from nearby audio elements.
.Pp
Three types of references are currently defined:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "NODEREF_SPRITE " -compact
.It NODEREF_SPRITE
Pointer to a static image of arbitrary size.
Visible elements of this type are drawn only when the
.Va redraw
flag of the parent map is set.
.It NODEREF_ANIM
Pointer to an animation of arbitrary size.
Visible elements of this type are redrawn every
.Va n
milliseconds (possibly by another thread on a multiprocessor system).
.It NODEREF_WARP
Pointer to a node residing another map.
Objects coming in contact with this type of element are transported to
coordinates
.Va x ,
.Va y ,
.Va z
of map
.Va m .
.El
.Pp
Graphical elements define two displacements in pixels of the image from
the tile's origin, one for centering and the other for motion.
.Pp
The centering offset is typically assigned by a level designer, and the
motion offset is controlled by the animation/positioning system.
If the map is drawn scaled, the centering offset is scaled to the
tile size, but the motion offset is not.
.Pp
Graphical elements provide the renderer with a list of graphical transforms
that should be applied before the tile is drawn (the resulting tile is cached),
and a layer index which defines the order of blitting.

nodes, assuming that no node is currently allocated.
.Fn map_alloc_nodes

freeing the excess ones.
.Fn map_resize
returns 0 on sucess or -1 on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn map_set_zoom
function sets the zoom factor for a map.
Unless the factor is 100%, pixmap scaling is performed for graphical elements.

function frees resources allocated by a node (such as the reference stack).
To reinitialize a node, this function must be followed by
.Fn node_init .
.Pp
The
.Fn node_load
function loads a node from
.Fa buf ,
returning 0 on success or -1 on failure.

The

function initializes a node element structure.

The
.Fn noderef_set_center
function sets the centering offset of a graphical element.
.Fn noderef_set_motion
sets the motion offset of a graphical element.
These offsets must not exceed

and
.Dv NODEREF_MAX_MOTION
pixels, respectively.
.Pp
The
.Fn noderef_destroy
function frees the resources reserved by a node element.
It must be followed by
.Fa noderef_init
to reinitialize the node element structure.
.Pp
The
.Fn noderef_load
and
.Fn noderef_save

.Pp
The
.Fn node_move_ref
function moves
.Fa src_r
from
.Fa src_node
to the node at specific map coordinates and returns 0, or -1 if
the coordinates are outside of
.Fa dst_map .
The element is associated with the layer
.Fa dlayer ,
unless it is -1.
.Pp
The
.Fn node_copy_ref
function inserts a copy of
.Fa src_r
on top of
.Fa dst_node,
and associate with
.Fa dst_layer
(unless it is -1).
.Pp
The
.Fn node_remove_ref
function detaches and destroys the given node element.
.Pp
The
.Fn node_add_*
functions create new node elements.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "node_add_sprite() "
.It Fn node_add_sprite
Creates a graphical element consisting of a single pointer to a
.Xr SDL_Surface 3 .
Since graphics are managed by Agar objects, the reference is actually a
pointer to an object and an index into this object's
.Va gfx->sprites[]
array.
.It Fn node_add_anim
Creates a graphical element consisting of a series of frames.
The animation reference consists of a pointer to an object and an index into
this object's
.Va gfx->anims[]
array.
.It Fn node_add_warp
Creates a warp point, where
.Fa new_map
is the pathname of the destination map (as returned by
.Fn object_copy_name ) ,
and the
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
and
.Fa dir
arguments describe the initial position and direction of the object in the
destination map.
.El
.Sh TROUBLETONS
The node operation functions should probably use a state variable instead of
arguments for the layer number.
.Pp
.Dv NODEREF_WARP
could probably be replaced by a "warp" object.
.Pp
The
.Dv NODEREF_REGEN
and
.Dv NODEREF_BIO
flags could be replaced by a special type of reference for such attributes.
