.Sh NAME
.Nm map
.Nd agar map
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <engine/map.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
An agar map is an array of node structures.
Each node may contain a stack of node reference structures,
which point to arbitrary structures and an offset within them.
Flags may alter the meaning of the offset.

.Pp
The
.Fn map_init
function initializes a map identified by the string
.Fa name .
The
.Fa media
argument, if non-null, specifies an archive from which to load audio and
video data.
The
.Fa flags
argument is currently ignored.
.Pp
The
.Fn map_destroy
function frees resources allocated by a map.
.Pp
The
.Fn map_load
function loads a map from file descriptor
.Fa fd .
The
.Fn map_save
function saves a map to file descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Pp
The
.Fn map_clean
function reinitializes all nodes on
.Fa map
and add a reference to offset
.Fa offs
of object
.Fa ob
with the node flags set to
.Fa nflags
and the node reference flags set to
.Fa rflags .
.Pp
The
.Fn map_allocnodes
function allocates
.Fa w
x
.Fa h
nodes.
The
.Fn map_freenodes
function releases nodes allocated for map
.Fa map .
