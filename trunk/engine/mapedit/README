The map editor manipulates map entry references (sprites and animations,
currently), in addition to various properties.

Each map entry has a linked list of structures containing a pointer to
an object, flags, and an offset (whose meaning is dependent to flags).
The lowest sprite/animation on the stack is drawn first.

The editor has 3 `windows'. The tile stack (left) displays the stack of
references for the map entry under the cursor. The tile list (right)
shows a circular list of available sprites/animations for the current
object. The object list (top) shows the icons for all objects known by
the map editor.
