.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/mapedit/mapview.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget displays
.Xr map 3
structures.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft struct mapview *
.Fn mapview_new "struct region *reg" "struct map *m" "int flags" \
                "int rw" "int rh"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn mapview_init "struct mapview *mv" "struct map *m" "int flags" \
                 "int rw" "int rh"
.Pp
.Pp

.Fn mapview_center "struct mapview *mv" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn mapview_zoom "struct mapview *mv" "int zoom"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn mapview_new
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
widget.
The
.Fn mapview_init
function initializes a
.Nm
widget of size
.Fa rw
x
.Fa rh
displaying map
.Fa m .
The
.Fa flags
can be changed at runtime, and may include:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define MAPVIEW_EDIT		0x001	/* Mouse/keyboard edition */
#define MAPVIEW_INDEPENDENT	0x002	/* Zoom/ss independent from map */
#define MAPVIEW_TILEMAP		0x004	/* Map of `source' nodes */
#define MAPVIEW_GRID		0x008	/* Display a grid */
#define MAPVIEW_PROPS		0x010	/* Display node properties */
#define MAPVIEW_SAVEABLE	0x100	/* Load/save keys */
#define MAPVIEW_NO_CURSOR	0x200	/* Hide cursor */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Dv MAPVIEW_EDIT
flag enables write operations on the map.
.Dv MAPVIEW_TILEMAP
allows nodes on this map to be selected as source nodes for level edition
operations.
The latter two flags are only available if the level editor,
.Xr mapedit 3 ,
is initialized.
.Pp
The
.Dv MAPVIEW_INDEPENDENT
flag enables the use of zoom factors and soft-scroll offsets that are
independent from the map's, but are not saved with
.Xr map
states.
.Pp
The
.Fn mapview_center
function centers the view around the node at
.Fa x ,
.Fa y .
.Pp
The
.Fn mapview_zoom
function sets the scaling factor to
.Fa zoom ,
in % of the default tile geometry.
.Fn mapview_zoom
returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
.Sh SELECTIONS
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn mapview_set_selection "struct mapview *mv" "int x" "int y" \
                          "int w" "int h"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn mapview_get_selection "struct mapview *mv" "int *x" "int *y" \
                          "int *w" "int *h"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn mapview_set_selection
function sets the active selection to
.Fa w
by
.Fa h
nodes at map position
.Fa x ,
.Fa y .
.Fn mapview_set_selection
also disables any mouse selection in progress.
.Pp
The
.Fn mapview_get_selection
returns 1 if there is an active selection or 0 if there is none.
If there is no selection, no value is written to
.Fa x ,
.Fa y ,
.Fa w
and
.Fa h .

.Dv MAPVIEW_EDIT
is set.
.It window-mousebuttonup
Stop scrolling or terminate a selection.
.It window-mousemotion
If the right mouse button is held, pan the view.
