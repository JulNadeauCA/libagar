.It
storage of sprite/animations or audio.

.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct object *"
.Fn object_new "char *type" "char *name" "char *archive" "int flags" \
               "const void *ops"
.Ft "void"

                "int flags" "const void *ops"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_destroy "void *ob"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn object_new
function allocates, initializes and attaches a new, generic object to the
world.
The
.Fn object_init
function initializes
.Fa ob
as an object of type
.Fa type .
.Pp
If the
.Fa archive
argument is not NULL, it identifies a
.Xr fobj 3
(with the
.Sq .fob
suffix) to be looked up in the data directories (the
.Sq path.data_path
setting) and loaded.
.Pp
The
.Fa ops
argument, if not NULL, is a pointer to the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct object_ops {
	void	(*destroy)(void *ob);		/* Free resources */
	int	(*load)(void *ob, int fd);	/* Load from fd */
	int	(*save)(void *ob, int fd);	/* Save to fd */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument may contain:
.Bd -literal
#define OBJECT_ART		0x01	/* Load graphics from archive */
#define OBJECT_ART_CACHE	0x02	/* Never decrement the ref count */
#define OBJECT_ART_CAN_FAIL	0x04	/* Graphic load can fail */
#define OBJECT_AUDIO		0x08	/* Load audio from archive */
#define OBJECT_AUDIO_CACHE	0x10	/* Never decrement the ref count */
#define OBJECT_AUDIO_CAN_FAIL	0x20	/* Audio load can fail */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn object_destroy
function is called to free all resources associated with
.Fa ob .
.Sh SAVING STATES
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_load "void *ob"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_load_from "void *ob" "char *path"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_save "void *ob"
.Pp
.Ft "char *"
.Fn object_path "char *name" "const char *suffix"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn object_load
function loads the state of
.Fa ob
from the first file found in data directories.
.Fn object_loadfrom
loads the state of
.Fa ob
from the file at
.Fa path .
.Fn object_save
saves the state of
.Fa ob
to the user's data directory.
.Pp
The
.Fn object_path
function searches the data directories for a file matching the
.Fa name
and
.Fa suffix
arguments.
If the file is found, a pointer to the full pathname is returned,
otherwise a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned and the error message may be retrieved using
.Xr error_get 3 .
.Sh MAP OPERATIONS
Agar organizes maps in such a way that an arbitrary amount of node items
(noderefs) may point to specific data inside specific objects.
Objects that wish to assume a unique position on a map need a back reference
to the map.
This back reference is defined by the
.Va pos
member of the object structure.
If
.Va pos
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it points to a structure describing the map, the node coordinates and the
noderef which represents this object.
.Pp
The noderef representing the object does not have the
.Dv NODEREF_SAVEABLE
flag set, so the noderef will not be included in
.Xr map 3
states.
Instead, the object implementations manually handle creation, loading and
saving of these noderefs.
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_set_position "void *ob" "struct noderef *nref" "struct map *map" \
                        "Uint32 x" "Uint32 y"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_move "void *ob" "struct map *dst_map" "Uint32 dst_x" "Uint32 dst_y"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_control "void *ob" "struct input *in" "int center"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_vanish "void *ob"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn object_set_position
function points an object's position to
.Fa nref
on the node at the
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
coordinates of
.Fa map .
.Fn object_set_position
does not create any noderef but if there is currently a position, its noderef
is removed.
.Fn object_set_position
is usually called after a new noderef is created (with
.Fn node_add_sprite
or
.Fn node_add_anim ,
for example), in order to update the object's back reference.
.Pp
The
.Fn object_move
function moves
.Fa ob
from its current position to the
.Fa dst_x
and
.Fa dst_y
coordinates of
.Fa dst_map .
.Pp
The
.Fn object_control
function assigns the input device
.Fa in
to the position associated with
.Fa ob ,
centering the view and enabling soft-scrolling if
.Fa center
is non-zero .
.Pp
The
.Fn object_vanish
function removes the current position associated with
.Fa ob
by setting
.Va pos
to
.Dv NULL ,
as well as removing the associated noderef.
.Fn object_vanish
returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
.Sh OBJECT TABLES
These functions load and save arrays of object names with reference counts.
This allows load/save routines to keep dependency lists and reference objects
with indexes instead of strings.
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct object_table *"
.Fn object_table_new "void"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_table_destroy "struct object_table *table"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_table_insert "struct object_table *table" "struct object *obj"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_table_save "struct fobj_buf *buf" "struct object_table *table"
.Pp
.Ft "struct object_table *"
.Fn object_table_load "int fd" "char *objname"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn object_table_new
function allocates, initializes and return a new object table with 0 elements.
The
.Fn object_table_destroy
frees
.Fa table .
.Pp
The
.Fn object_table_insert
function inserts
.Fa obj
in
.Fa table .
.Pp
The
.Fn object_table_save
function write
.Fa table
to
.Fa buf .
The
.Fn object_table_load
function allocates and reads the object table from
.Fa fd .
