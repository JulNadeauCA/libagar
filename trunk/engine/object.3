.Dt OBJECT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm object
.Nd AGAR object abstraction
.Sh SYNOPSIS
#include <engine/object.h>
#include <engine/map.h>
#include <engine/input.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
layer implements:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
garbage collection.
.It
the storage of sprites.
.It
a list of active object structures.
.El
.Pp
Each object structure holds optional entry points,
.Pp
.Bd -literal
struct obvec {
	void	(*destroy)(void *ob);		/* called before destroy */
	int	(*load)(void *ob, int fd);	/* load from fd */
	int	(*save)(void *ob, int fd);	/* save to fd */
	int	(*link)(void *ob);		/* called before link */
	int	(*unlink)(void *ob);		/* called after unlink */
};
.Ed
.Pp
which are called by
the generic
.Fn object_destroy ,
.Fn object_link ,
.Fn object_unlink ,
.Fn object_load ,
.Fn object_save
and
.Fn object_dump
functions.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_init "struct object *ob" "char *name" "char *arname" "int flags" "struct obvec *vec"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_destroy "struct object *ob"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_link "struct object *ob"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_unlink "struct object *ob"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
.Fn object_init
initializes
.Fa ob
and loads data from
.Fa arname
into the static media pool, if
.Fa arname
is not NULL.
.Fn object_destroy
If frees all resources associated with this object.
If
.Fa flags
contains
.Dv OBJ_ART
or
.Dv OBJ_AUDIO ,
graphics and samples are loaded from media.
.Pp
.Fn object_link
appends
.Fa ob
to the list of active objects, and
.Fn object_unlink
removes
.Fa ob
from the list of active objects and adds it to the garbage queue.
The garbage collector will eventually call the
.Em destroy
op to request all allocated memory to be freed.
The object list lock must be held when calls are made to
.Fn object_link
and
.Fn object_link .
.Sh SAVING STATES
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_load "struct object *ob"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_loadfrom "struct object *ob" "char *path"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn object_save "struct object *ob"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Pp
.Fn object_load
loads the state of
.Fa ob
from the first file found in data directories.
.Fn object_loadfrom
loads the state of
.Fa ob
from the file at
.Fa path .
.Fn object_save
saves the state of
.Fa ob
to the user's data directory.
These routines are called when the world's list of objects is
locked.
.Sh MAP OPERATIONS
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct mappos *"
.Fn object_addpos "void *ob" "Uint32 offs" "Uint32 flags" "struct input *in" "struct map *map" "Uint32 x" "Uint32 y"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn object_delpos "void *ob" "Uint32 offs" "Uint32 flags" "struct map *map" "Uint32 x" "Uint32 y"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Fn object_addpos
adds a reference to
.Fa ob
at the given map coordinates, and creates a back reference (mappos)
structure, which defines the single position of this object on a map,
as well as speed, direction (mapdir) and an optional input device pointer.
.Pp
.Fn object_delpos
removes a reference to
.Fa ob
at the given map coordinates, and destroys the back reference (mappos)
structure.
