.Sh NAME
.Nm physics
.Nd agar physics simulation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/physics.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
interface implements two-dimensional movement.
.Bd -literal
enum {
	DIR_UP =	0x01,
	DIR_DOWN =	0x02,
	DIR_LEFT =	0x04,
	DIR_RIGHT =	0x08,
	DIR_ALL =	0xff
};
.Ed
.Sh GENERIC DIRECTIONS
This interface implements two-dimensional movement of an undefined construct
inside an undefined area, with a key delay and key repeat.

.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn gendir_init
function initializes a generic direction.
.Pp
The
.Fn gendir_set
function sets the direction of
.Fa dir
to
.Fa direction .
The
.Fn gendir_unset
requests
.Fa dir
to no longer move in
.Fa direction .
.Pp
The
.Fn gendir_move
function is usually called from a timer callback to update the direction
.Fa dir ,
returning the direction towards which the object should move, or 0 if it
should remain in its current position.
.Pp
If the timer callback has moved object, it should call
.Fn gendir_postmove
with the return value of
.Fn gendir_move
as the
.Fa moved
argument, to effect a
.Fn gendir_unset
operation and increment the necessary counters.
.Sh MAP DIRECTIONS
This interface implements two-dimensional movement of map references between
adjacent map nodes.
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn mapdir_init "struct mapdir *dir" "struct object *ob" "struct map *map" \

.Pp

                    "Uint32 moved"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn mapdir_init
function initializes a map direction for object
.Fa ob
on map
.Fa map .
The
.Fa flags
may contain:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define DIR_SCROLLVIEW	0x01	/* Scroll view if we reach boundaries. */
#define DIR_SOFTSCROLL	0x02	/* Animate move from node to node. */
#define DIR_STATIC	0x04	/* Don't change sprites with directions. */
#define DIR_PASSTHROUGH	0x08	/* Pass through map nodes. */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn mapdir_set
function sets the direction of
.Fa dir
to
.Fa direction .
The
.Fn mapdir_unset
requests
.Fa dir
to no longer move in
.Fa direction .
.Pp
The
.Fn mapdir_move
function is usually called from a timer callback to update the direction
.Fa dir ,
returning the direction towards which the object should move, or 0 if it
should remain in its current position.
The
.Fa map_x
and
.Fa map_y
arguments should point to the current coordinates of the object on the map,
and will be updated accordingly.
.Pp
If the timer callback has moved the map reference, it should call
.Fn mapdir_postmove
with the return value of
.Fn mapdir_move
as the
.Fa moved
argument, to effect a
.Fn mapdir_unset
operation, increment the necessary counters or ensure the object keeps
moving.
The
.Fa map_x
and
.Fa map_y
arguments are the same pointers that were passed to
.Fn mapdir_move .
