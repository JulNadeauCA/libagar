.Dt VERSION 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm version
.Nd agar data file versioning
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/version.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
interface encodes, or verifies the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct version {
	char	*name;			/* Signature */
	Uint32	 vermaj, vermin;	/* Version */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Dv vermaj
member is incremented whenever a change introduces binary incompatibility
with previous versions of the data files.
This is avoided by using padding whenever possible.
.Pp
The
.Dv vermin
member is incremented whenever a change is made in the data file, but binary
compatibility is preserved.
.Sh VERSIONING
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn version_read "int fd" "const struct version *ver"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn version_write "int fd" "const struct version *ver"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn version_read
function reads version information from file descriptor
.Fa fd
and returns 0 if the following data is binary compatible against the version
represented by
.Fa ver ,
or -1 if the data is not compatible.
.Pp
The
.Fn version_write
function writes version information from the structure
.Fa ver
to file descriptor
.Fa fd .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in AGAR 1.0
