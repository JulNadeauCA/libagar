.Sh NAME
.Nm view
.Nd agar graphic management interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/view.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar
.Nm
layer manages the video display.
It also implements a series of macros for basic pixel operations.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_ViewInit "int w" "int h" "int bpp" "u_int flags"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ViewDestroy "void"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_ViewSetRefreshRate "int fps"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn view_init
function initializes the graphic display if there is one available,
returning 0 on success and -1 on failure.
If the
.Sq view.opengl
property is set,
.Fn view_init
will attempt to create an OpenGL rendering context, and the GUI will arrange
for widgets to be rendered using OpenGL agPrim.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ViewDestroy
function frees resources allocated by the view structure.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SetRefreshRate
function sets the nominal refresh rate, given in frames/second.
The default
.Fn event_loop
will attempt to draw exactly that number of frames per second and then idle
as much as possible.
.Sh GRAPHIC SURFACES
.nr nS 1
.Ft "SDL_Surface *"
.Fn AG_DupSurface "SDL_Surface *src"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ScaleSurface "SDL_Surface *src" "Uint16 width" "Uint16 height" "SDL_Surface **dst"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_SamePixelFmt "SDL_Surface *s1" "SDL_Surface *s2"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_SetAlphaPixels "SDL_Surface *surface" "Uint8 alpha"
.Pp
.Ft "GLuint"
.Fn AG_SurfaceTexture "SDL_Surface *src" "GLfloat *texcoord"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_UpdateRectQ "int x" "int y" "int w" "int h"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_DumpSurface "SDL_Surface *su" "char *path_save"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
These functions operate on
.Xr SDL_Surface 3
structures.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_DupSurface
returns a newly allocated surface containing a copy of
.Fa src .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ScaleSurface
functions performs pixmap scaling of surface
.Fa src
to
.Fa width
by
.Fa height
pixels.
If
.Fa dst
is NULL, a new surface is allocated.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SamePixelFmt
function returns 1 if the surfaces
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
share the same depth, RGBA masks and colorkey.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SetAlphaPixels
function changes the alpha value of all pixels except those with an
alpha channel of 0, to
.Fa alpha .
.Pp
If OpenGL support is available,
.Fn AG_SurfaceTexture
creates an OpenGL texture from
.Fa src
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_UpdateRectQ
function queues the update of a video region.
With direct video rendering mode, this adds a
.Ft SDL_Rect
to an array that will be passed to
.Xr SDL_UpdateRects 3 .
With the OpenGL rendering mode, the entire display is queued for update.
.Fa rd
to the dirty rectangle array the event loop will pass to
.Xr SDL_UpdateRects 3
when the display is refreshed.
.Fn VIEW_UPDATE
is a no-op if OpenGL is enabled.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_DumpSurface
function encode a JPEG image file from the contents of a surface.
If the argument is not NULL, the name of the file is copied to
.Fa path_save ,
which must be
.Dv MAXPATHLEN
bytes in size.
.Sh PIXEL OPERATIONS
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_CLIPPED_PIXEL "SDL_Surface *s" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_UNCLIPPED_PIXEL "SDL_Surface *s" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft "Uint32"
.Fn AG_GET_PIXEL "SDL_Surface *s" "Uint8 *p"
.Pp
.Ft "Uint32"
.Fn AG_GET_PIXEL2 "SDL_Surface *s" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_PUT_PIXEL "SDL_Surface *s" "Uint8 *p" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_PUT_PIXEL2 "SDL_Surface *s" "int x" "int y" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED "SDL_Surface *s" "int x" "int y" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_BLEND_RGBA "SDL_Surface *s" "Uint8 *p" "Uint8 r" "Uint8 g" "Uint8 b" "Uint8 a" "enum ag_blend_func func"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_BLEND_RGBA2 "SDL_Surface *s" "int x" "int y" "Uint8 r" "Uint8 g" "Uint8 b" "Uint8 a" "enum ag_blend_func func"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_BLEND_RGBA2_CLIPPED "SDL_Surface *s" "int x" "int y" "Uint8 r" "Uint8 g" "Uint8 b" "Uint8 alpha" "enum ag_blend_func func"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL "Uint8 *p" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2 "int x" "int y" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED "int x" "int y" "Uint32 c"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The macros
.Fn AG_CLIPPED_PIXEL
and
.Fn AG_UNCLIPPED_PIXEL
evaluate whether the pixel at the given coordinates resides inside or outside
of the clipping rectangle of the given surface.
.Pp
.Fn AG_GET_PIXEL
returns a 32-bit interpretation of the pixel at the given location
.Fa p
in the pixel data of the surface
.Fa s .
The
.Fn AG_GET_PIXEL2
variant finds the location of the pixel in the surface from the coordinates
.Fa x ,
.Fa y .
.Pp
.Fn AG_PUT_PIXEL
and
.Fn AG_PUT_PIXEL2
write the color
.Fa c
to the pixel at the given location, without doing any clipping.
The
.Fn AG_PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED
variant ensures that the pixel is inside the clipping rectangle of the surface
before writing to it.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_BLEND_RGBA ,
.Fn AG_BLEND_RGBA2
and
.Fn AG_BLEND_RGBA2_CLIPPED
macros operate in a manner similar to
.Fn AG_PUT_PIXEL* ,
except that the destination pixel is alpha-blended with the color described
by the given RGB triplet, whose weight is defined by the
.Fa alpha
parameter.
The
.Fa func
argument may be one of:
.Bd -literal
enum ag_blend_func {
	AG_ALPHA_OVERLAY,		/* dA = sA+dA */
	AG_ALPHA_SRC,			/* dA = sA */
	AG_ALPHA_DST,			/* dA = dA */
	AG_ALPHA_MEAN,			/* dA = (sA+dA)/2 */
	AG_ALPHA_SOURCE_MINUS_DST,	/* dA = (sA-dA) */
	AG_ALPHA_DST_MINUS_SOURCE,	/* dA = (dA-sA) */
	AG_ALPHA_PYTHAGOREAN		/* dA = sqrt(sA^2+dA^2) */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The macros
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL ,
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2
and
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED
behave in a manner similar to
.Fn AG_PUT_PIXEL* ,
except that they are optimized for the display surface.
For instance, support for specific display depths may have been disabled
at compile-time.
.Sh WINDOW SYSTEM
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ViewAttach "AG_Window *child"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ViewDetach "AG_Window *child"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_ViewDetachQueued "void"
.Pp
.Ft "AG_Window *"
.Fn AG_FindWindow "char *name"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ViewAttach
function attaches the window pointed to by
.Fa child
to the view.
The
.Fn AG_ViewDetach
function detaches the window pointed to by
.Fa child
from the view by adding it to the detach queue.
The detachment will be performed later by
.Fa AG_ViewDetachQueued .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_FindWindow
functions looks for a window identified by
.Fa name
and return NULL if there is no such window.
