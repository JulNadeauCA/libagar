.Sh NAME
.Nm view
.Nd agar graphic engine
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/view.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The agar
.Nm
layer currently implement two graphic engines:
.Bl -tag -width "GFX_ENGINE_TILEBASED "
.It GFX_ENGINE_GUI
The root window is empty.
Windows are drawn directly to video memory, and can move independently of
tile granularity.
.It GFX_ENGINE_TILEBASED
A single map is shown inside the root window.
A map mask allows windows to be drawn on top of the map, as long as they
are moved according to tile granularity.
.El
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_init "gfx_engine_t engine"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_destroy "struct viewport *view"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn view_init
function initializes the graphic engine, and accepts the following argument:
.Bd -literal
typedef enum {
	GFX_ENGINE_GUI,
	GFX_ENGINE_TILEBASED
} gfx_engine_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn view_init
function calls
.Xr SDL_SetVideoMode 3 ,
.Xr SDL_WM_SetCaption 3
and
.Xr SDL_ShowCursor 3 ,
and allocates a
.Xr rootmap 3
structure if
.Dv GFX_ENGINE_TILEBASED
is used.
.Sh WINDOW SYSTEM
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_attach "struct window *child"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_detach "struct window *child"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn view_focus "struct window *window"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn view_attach
function attaches the window pointed to by
.Fa child
to the view.
The
.Fn view_detach
function detaches the window pointed to by
.Fa child
from the view.
.Pp
The
.Fn view_focus
function places the given
.Fa window
at the tail of the window list (so it is drawn last, at the top of
other windows).
.Sh VIDEO SURFACES
.nr nS 1
.Ft "SDL_Surface *"
.Fn view_surface "int flags" "int width" "int height"
.Pp
.Ft "SDL_Surface *"
.Fn view_scale_surface "SDL_Surface *source" "Uint16 w" "Uint16 h"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn view_unused_surface "SDL_Surface *scaled"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn view_surface
function returns a newly allocated
.Xr SDL_Surface 3
structure of the given size, with masks in host byte order.
.Pp
The
.Fn view_scale_surface
function returns a pointer to a
.Xr SDL_Surface 3
structure which holds a copy of
.Fa source ,
bitmap-scaled to
.Fa w
by
.Fa h
pixels.
If surface caching is enabled,
.Fn view_scale_surface
may return a precalculated surface, so the surface must be marked as unused
with
.Fn view_unused_surface ,
instead of freed directly with
.Xr SDL_FreeSurface 3 .

The
.Nm
interface first appeared in AGAR 1.0
