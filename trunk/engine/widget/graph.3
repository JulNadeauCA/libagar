.Bd -literal
#include <engine/widget/graph.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget implements a scrollable graph display.
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
.Pp
.Xr object 3 ->
.Xr widget 3 ->
.Nm .
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct graph *"
.Fn graph_new "void *parent, const char *caption, enum graph_type type" "int flags" "graph_val_t yrange"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn graph_init "struct graph *graph, const char *caption" "enum graph_type type, int flags, graph_val_t yrange"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn graph_new
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
widget.
.Fn graph_init
initializes a
.Nm
widget.
.Fa caption
is a short description of the graph; it is truncated if its length
exceeds
.Dv GRAPH_CAPTION_MAX - 1
characters.
.Fa yrange
is the maximum expected value for which to adjust display.
The
.Fa type
argument is one of:
.Bd -literal
enum graph_type {
	GRAPH_POINTS,   /* Dots */
	GRAPH_LINES     /* Lines */
} type;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
may include:
.Bd -literal
#define GRAPH_SCROLL  0x01   /* Scroll if the end is not visible */
#define GRAPH_ORIGIN  0x02   /* Visible origin */
.Ed
.Sh PLOTTING
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct graph_item *"
.Fn graph_add_item "struct graph *graph, const char *name" "Uint8 r, Uint8 g, Uint8 b, Uint32 limit"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn graph_plot "struct graph_item *item" "graph_val_t val"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn graph_add_item
function inserts a new item into
.Fa graph .
If the length of
.Fa name
exceeds
.Dv GRAPH_ITEM_NAME_MAX - 1
bytes, the string is truncated.
The
.Fa r ,
.Fa g ,
.Fa b
triplet composes a color to visually identify the item.
.Fa limit
is the maximum number of points (if 0, the maximum is implicitely 0xffffffff-1).
.Pp
The
.Fn graph_plot
function adds a value
.Fa val
to the graph item
.Fa item .
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget reacts to the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "window-mousebuttondown"
.It window-mousemotion
Scroll (x motion) or change the origin position (y motion).
.It window-keydown
Key 0 moves to offset 0, left key scrolls left, right key scrolls right,
.It window-mousebuttonup
Stop moving.
.It window-mousebuttondown
Start moving.
.El
