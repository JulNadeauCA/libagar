.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget displays a string of text, which can change at runtime.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct label *"
.Fn label_new "struct region *reg" "int w" "int h" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft "struct label *"
.Fn label_polled_new "struct region *reg" "int w" "int h" \
                     "pthread_mutex_t *mutex" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn label_init "struct label *label" "enum label_type type" "const char *s" \
               "int w" "int h"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn label_new
function allocates, initializes and attaches a
.Nm
widget of size
.Fa w
x
.Fa h
pixels.
The
.Fa fmt
argument is a
.Xr printf 3
style format string.
.Pp
The
.Fn label_polled_new
function allocates, initializes and attaches a
.Nm
with contents updated before the widget is redrawn.
The draw operation will attempt to acquire
.Fa mutex ,
unless it is
.Dv NULL .
.Fa fmt
is a
.Xr printf 3
like format string, except that each subsequent argument is a pointer to a
value.
The
.Fa fmt
format string may include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "%d, %i, %x"
.It %d, %i, %x
int
.It %o, %u, %X
unsigned int
.It %c
char
.It %s
char *
.It %p
void *
.It %[u8]
Uint8 *
.It %[s8]
Sint8 *
.It %[u16]
Uint16 *
.It %[s16]
Sint16 *
.It %[u32]
Uint32 *
.It %[s32]
Sint32 *
.It %[wxh]
SDL_Rect *
.It %[x,y]
SDL_Rect *
.It %[rect]
SDL_Rect *
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn label_init
function initializes a
.Nm
widget.
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv LABEL_STATIC ,
the
.Fa s
argument is the string to display.
If
.Fa type
is LABEL_POLLED ,
the
.Fa s
argument is the format string.
.Pp
The
justification defaults to
.Dv LABEL_LEFT ,
and may be one of:
.Bd -literal
enum {
	LABEL_LEFT,
	LABEL_CENTER,
	LABEL_RIGHT
} justify;
