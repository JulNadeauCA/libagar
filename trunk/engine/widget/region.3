.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/widget/widget.h>
#include <engine/widget/window.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
structure is a simple container for widgets.
.Xr window 3
objects may contain a list of
.Nm
structures, and
.Nm
structures may contain a list of
.Xr widget 3
structures.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft struct region *
.Fn region_new "struct window *parent" "int flags" "int rx" "int ry" "int rw" "int rh"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn region_init "struct region *region" "int flags" "int rx" "int ry" "int rw" "int rh"
.Pp

.Fn region_attach "struct region *parent" "struct widget *child"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn region_detach "struct region *parent" "struct widget *child"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn region_new
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
structure.
The
.Fn region_init
function initializes a
.Nm
structure.
The
.Fa rx ,
.Fa ry ,
.Fa rw
and
.Fa rh
arguments are percentiles of the window space, or fixed coordinates if
negative.
The region takes all remaining space if coordinates are zero.
The
.Fa flags
can be changed at runtime, and may include:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define REGION_HALIGN	0x01	/* Align widgets horizontally */
#define REGION_VALIGN	0x02	/* Align widgets vertically */
#define REGION_LEFT	0x04	/* Left/top justify widgets */
#define REGION_CENTER	0x08	/* Center widgets */
#define REGION_RIGHT	0x10	/* Right/down justify widgets */
#define REGION_BORDER	0x20	/* Draw region decorations */
