.Dt WINDOW 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm window
.Nd agar window structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/widget/widget.h>
#include <engine/widget/window.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
structure implements a mobile, resizable windows containing
.Xr region 3
structures, which in turn contain
.Xr widget 3
structures.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "struct window *"
.Fn window_new "char *caption" "int flags" "int x" "int y" "int defw" \
               "int defh" "int minwidth, int minheight"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_init "struct window *win" "int flags" "int x" "int y" "int defw" \
                "int defh" "int minwidth" "int minheight"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_titlebar_printf "struct window *win" "const char *fmt" "..."
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_new
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
structure.
The
.Fn window_init
function initializes a
.Nm
structure.
The
.Fa caption
argument is a pointer to a null-terminated string that will be
displayed in the title bar (which can be changed at runtime using the
.Fn window_titlebar_printf
function).
The
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
arguments define the initial absolute position of the window, and are
ignored with the
.Dv WINDOW_CENTER
flag.
The
.Fa defw
and
.Fa defh
arguments define the default window geometry in pixels (or in percentiles
of the total view size with the
.Dv WINDOW_SCALE
flag).
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
can be changed at runtime, and may include:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define WINDOW_PLAIN		0x01	/* Solid, no borders */
#define WINDOW_ANIMATE		0x04	/* Redraw each tick */
#define WINDOW_TITLEBAR		0x08	/* Draw title bar */
#define WINDOW_ROUNDEDGES	0x10	/* Round edges */
#define WINDOW_SCALE		0x20	/* Scale regions/widgets */
#define WINDOW_SHOWN		0x40	/* Visible */
#define WINDOW_CENTER		0x80	/* Center window */
.Ed
.Sh VISIBILITY
.nr nS 1
.Ft int
.Fn window_show "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn window_show_locked "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn window_hide "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn window_hide_locked "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_resize "struct window *win"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_show
function displays an unlocked window.
The
.Fn window_show_locked
function displays a window assuming it is locked.
.Pp
The
.Fn window_hide
function hides an unlocked window.
The
.Fn window_hide_locked
function hides a window assuming it is locked.
.Pp
Those functions return non-zero if the window was previously visible.
.Pp
The
.Fn window_resize
function effects a change in window geometry by updating the regions
and widgets inside the window
.Fa win .
.Sh RENDERING
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn window_draw "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_animate "struct window *win"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_draw
function renders the window
.Fa win .
The
.Fn window_animate
function renders the animations inside the window
.Fa win .
.Sh EVENT DISPATCHING
.nr nS 1
.Ft int
.Fn window_event_all "SDL_Event *ev"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_event_all
function translates the
.Xr SDL_Event 3
pointed to by the
.Fa ev
argument and dispatches appropriate events to relevant widgets.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
object reacts directly to events of type
.Xr SDL_Event 3 ,
translates, and dispatches them to relevant
.Xr widget 3
structures.
.Pp
The
.Nm
object delivers the following events to
.Xr widget 3
objects:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Fn window-gainfocus "void"
Window gained focus.
.It Fn window-lostfocus "void"
Window no longer focused.
.It Fn window-mouseout "void"
The widget has the
.Dv WIDGET_MOUSEOUT
flag set and the mouse has moved outside of the widget area.
.It Fn window-mousemotion "int x" "int y" "int xrel" "int yrel"
The mouse cursor has moved to widget-relative coordinates
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
inside the widget area, and the widget currently holds the focus.
The
.Fa xrel
and
.Fa yrel
arguments represent the displacement relative to the last position of the
mouse cursor.
.It Fn window-mousebuttonup "int button" "int x" "int y"
The mouse button indexed by
.Fa button
was released at widget-relative
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
coordinates.
.It Fn window-mousebuttondown "int button" "int x" "int y"
The mouse button indexed by
.Fa button
was pressed at widget-relative
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
coordinates.
.It Fn window-keyup "int keysym" "int keymod"
The key identified by
.Fa keysym
was released, and the widget holds the focus.
.It Fn window-keydown "int keysym" "int keymod"
The key identified by
.Fa keysym
was pressed, and the widget holds the focus.
