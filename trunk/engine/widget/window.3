.Sh NAME
.Nm window
.Nd agar window system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <engine/widget/widget.h>
#include <engine/widget/window.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
object implements a mobile, resizable container for widgets; it is
itself derived from the
.Xr widget 3
structure and attached to a
.Xr view 3 .
Currently there is only one view; multiple views will be supported when
SDL implements multiple displays.
.Pp
The container behavior of a
.Nm
is much like a
.Xr vbox 3 .
Unless the
.Dv WINDOW_NO_TITLEBAR
flag is set, a
.Xr titlebar 3
widget is attached to the window at creation time.
.Pp
Initially, the window's widgets are queried for a default, minimum size, and
the window is sized accordingly.
After this initial sizing, widget containers may scale widgets to any size.

.Pp
The
.Fn window_new
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a new window.
.Fn window_init
initializes a
.Nm
structure.
.Pp
If the
.Fa name
argument is NULL, an unnamed window is created;
otherwise, a named window is created.
.Pp
If the name passed to
.Fn window_new
matches an existing window, the focus is placed on the existing
window, no new window is created and the function returns NULL.
.Pp
Acceptable flags include:
.Bd -literal
#define WINDOW_PERSISTENT	0x0001	/* Persistent position/geometry
				 	   (for named windows only) */
#define WINDOW_CASCADE		0x0002	/* Increment position slightly */
#define WINDOW_NO_TITLEBAR	0x0004	/* Disable the titlebar */
#define WINDOW_NO_DECORATIONS	0x0008	/* Disable the window borders */
#define WINDOW_HIDE		0x0010	/* Hide on window-close */
#define WINDOW_DETACH		0x0020	/* Detach on window-close */
#define WINDOW_MAXIMIZED	0x0040	/* Window is maximized */
#define WINDOW_ICONIFIED	0x0080	/* Window is minimized */
#define WINDOW_NO_HRESIZE	0x0100	/* Don't resize horizontally */
#define WINDOW_NO_VRESIZE	0x0200	/* Don't resize vertically */
#define WINDOW_NO_RESIZE	(WINDOW_NO_HRESIZE|WINDOW_NO_VRESIZE)
#define WINDOW_NO_CLOSE_BTN	0x0400	/* Disable close button */
#define WINDOW_NO_MINIMIZE_BTN	0x0800	/* Disable minimize button */
#define WINDOW_NO_MAXIMIZE_BTN	0x1000	/* Disable maximize button */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn window_set_caption
function sets the text displayed by the titlebar (if there is one).
The string is truncated if its length exceeds
.Dv LABEL_MAX
- 1 bytes.
.Pp
The
.Fn window_set_closure
function changes the current
.Sq window-close
event handler to one of the predefined handlers:
.Bd -literal
#define WINDOW_HIDE	0x0010	/* Hide on window-close */
#define WINDOW_DETACH	0x0020	/* Detach on window-close */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn window_set_padding
function defines the space in pixels separating the widgets from the edges
of the window.
.Pp
The
.Fn window_set_spacing
function defines the space separating the widgets from each other.
The default is 2 pixels.
.Pp
Note that
.fn window_set_spacing
only affects the widgets which are directly attached to the window.
For widgets that are attached to container widgets, it is the container
widgets that define spacing, as well as other aspects of widget
organization.
For instance, the
.Xr box 3
container widget provides a
.Fn box_set_spacing
function .
.Pp
The
.Fn window_set_position
function requests an initial window position, which may be one of:
.Bd -literal
enum window_alignment {
	WINDOW_UPPER_LEFT,
	WINDOW_MIDDLE_LEFT,
	WINDOW_LOWER_LEFT,
	WINDOW_UPPER_RIGHT,
	WINDOW_MIDDLE_RIGHT,
	WINDOW_LOWER_RIGHT,
	WINDOW_CENTER,
	WINDOW_LOWER_CENTER,
	WINDOW_UPPER_CENTER
};
.Ed
.Pp
If the
.Fa cascade
argument is 1, the window position is slightly incremented or decremented at
each call (depending on the preferred alignment).
.Pp
The
.Fn window_set_geometry
function allows manual modification of a window's position and size in terms
of pixels.
It should be invoked after the window's child widgets are created, otherwise
no minimum geometry will be enforced when the window is later resized.
.Pp
Finally, the
.Fn window_attach
function arranges for
.Fa pwin
to be the parent window of
.Fa win ,
such that
.Fa win
is automatically destroyed when
.Fa pwin
is detached (through
.Xr view_detach 3 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn window_detach
function removes
.Fa win
from its parent window
.Fa pwin .
.Sh VISIBILITY
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn window_show "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_hide "struct window *win"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn window_toggle_visibility "struct window *win"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_show
function marks
.Fa win
as visible.
.Fn window_hide
marks
.Fa win
as invisible.
.Fn window_toggle_visibility
inverts the visibility state of
.Fa win .
.Sh GENERIC EVENT HANDLERS
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn window_generic_detach "int argc" "union evarg *argv"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_generic_hide "int argc" "union evarg *argv"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn window_generic_show "int argc" "union evarg *argv"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn window_generic_detach
event handler detaches the window given as the first argument, freeing all
associated resources.
.Fn window_generic_hide
hides the window given as the first argument, if it is currently
visible.
.Fn window_generic_show
shows the window given as the first argument.
.Pp
The
.Fn window_set_closure
function is an alternative to assigning these event handlers manually.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget delivers the following events to its child widgets:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Fn window-mousemotion "int x" "int y" "int xrel" "int yrel" "int state"
The mouse cursor has moved to widget-relative coordinates
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
(which may be negative).
The
.Fa xrel
and
.Fa yrel
arguments represent the displacement relative to the last position of the
mouse cursor.
.Fa state
holds the present button state, as returned by
.Xr SDL_GetMouseState 3 .
Regardless of the mouse position, this event is posted to widgets that either
hold focus inside the focused window, or have the
.Dv WIDGET_UNFOCUSED_MOTION
flag set.
.It Fn window-mousebuttonup "int button" "int x" "int y"
The mouse button indexed by
.Fa button
was released at widget-relative
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
coordinates.
Regardless of the mouse position, this event is posted to the widget that
holds focus inside the focused window.
.It Fn window-mousebuttondown "int button" "int x" "int y"
The mouse button indexed by
.Fa button
was pressed at widget-relative
.Fa x ,
.Fa y
coordinates, which must be inside the widget area.
.It Fn window-keyup "int keysym" "int keymod"
The key identified by
.Fa keysym
was released, and the widget holds the focus.
.It Fn window-keydown "int keysym" "int keymod" "int unicode"
The key identified by
.Fa keysym
was pressed, and the widget holds the focus.
.It Fn window-close "void"
The window's titlebar close button was pressed.
This event is generated after the window is no longer visible.
.It Fn window-shown "void"
The window is now visible.
.It Fn window-hidden "void"
The window is no longer visible.
