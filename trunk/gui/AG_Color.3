.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Color
.Nd agar color structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Many functions in Agar accept
.Fa AG_Color
parameters.
This structure describes a color in terms of its red, green and blue and
alpha components:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct ag_color {
	Uint8 r, g, b, a;
} AG_Color;
.Ed
.Pp
The alpha component may or may not be used in a particular context; a value
of 0 is fully transparent and 255 is fully opaque.
.Sh INTERFACE
.nr nS 1
.Ft AG_Color
.Fn AG_ColorRGB "Uint8 r" "Uint8 g" "Uint8 b"
.Pp
.Ft AG_Color
.Fn AG_ColorRGBA "Uint8 r" "Uint8 g" "Uint8 b" "Uint8 a"
.Pp
.Ft AG_Color
.Fn AG_ColorHex "Uint32 hex"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn AG_ColorCompare "AG_Color a" "AG_Color b"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_ColorRGB
routine returns an
.Ft AG_Color
from the given red, green and blue components.
The alpha component is initialized to 255 (opaque).
.Pp
.Fn AG_ColorRGBA
accepts an explicit alpha component.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ColorHex
returns an
.Nm
structure from an argument of the form 0xRRGGBBAA.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ColorCompare
function returns non-zero if the two given colors differ.

.Sh HISTORY
Colors in Agar were originally described as 32-bit packed pixel values.
This was replaced by the
.Nm
structure in Agar 1.4.
