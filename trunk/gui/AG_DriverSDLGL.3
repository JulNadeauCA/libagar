.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_DriverSDLGL
.Nd agar SDL OpenGL driver
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar
.Va sdlgl
driver provides an interface to the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library,
and renders GUI elements as OpenGL primitives and textures.
Using
.Xr AG_InitVideoSDL 3
as opposed to
.Xr AG_InitGraphics 3 ,
it is possible to attach Agar to an existing SDL display surface.
If the SDL surface has the
.Dv SDL_OPENGL
flag set, Agar selects the
.Va sdlgl
driver automatically.
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
.Xr AG_Driver 3 ->
.Xr AG_DriverSw 3 ->
.Nm .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
AG_InitGraphics("sdlgl(width=640:height=480:depth=32)");
AG_InitGraphics("sdlgl(out=%08d.jpg:outFirst=10)");
AG_InitVideoSDL(screen, 0);
