.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the OpenGL-specific functions exported by Agar.
These functions are only available where Agar is compiled with OpenGL support
(i.e.,
.Dv HAVE_OPENGL
is set), and are mostly useful for implementing new OpenGL-based drivers (see
.Xr AG_Driver 3 ) .
Some of these functions are also useful to simplify texture management when
implementing OpenGL-specific Agar-GUI widgets.
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_InitContext "AG_Rect r"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_GL_InitContext
function is to be invoked by OpenGL-specific drivers to prepare the GL for
proper rendering of Agar GUI elements by setting the viewport, loading an
orthographic projection matrix, and initializing various OpenGL options.
.Fn AG_GL_InitContext
does not save the previous state, the caller is expected to do that.
The rectangle argument specifies the parameters to pass to
.Xr glViewport 3 ,
given in pixels.
.Sh TEXTURE/SURFACE MANAGEMENT
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_UploadTexture "Uint *texName" "AG_Surface *suSrc" "AG_TexCoord *tc"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_UpdateTexture "Uint texName" "AG_Surface *suSrc" "AG_TexCoord *tc"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_PrepareTexture "AG_Widget *widget" "int surfName"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurface "AG_Driver *drv" "AG_Widget *wid" "AG_Surface *s" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurfaceFrom "AG_Driver *drv" "AG_Widget *widSrc" "int surfName" "AG_Rect *r" "int x" "int y"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurfaceGL "AG_Driver *drv" "AG_Widget *wid" "AG_Surface *s" "float w" "float h"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurfaceFromGL "AG_Driver *drv" "AG_Widget *wid" "int surfName" "float w" "float h"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurfaceFlippedGL "AG_Driver *drv" "AG_Widget *wid" "int surfName" "float w" "float h"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_BackupSurfaces "AG_Driver *drv" "AG_Widget *wid"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_RestoreSurfaces "AG_Driver *drv" "AG_Widget *wid"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_GL_RenderToSurface "AG_Driver *drv" "AG_Widget *wid" "AG_Surface **sDst"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_GL_UploadTexture
operation converts the specified
.Xr AG_Surface 3
to an OpenGL texture, returning the GL texture handle in
.Fa texName .
Texture coordinates are returned into
.Fa tc
if non-NULL (i.e., X/Y coordinates are 0.0 and width/height are computed from
the original dimensions divided by the texture's power-of-two dimensions).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_GL_UpdateTexture
operation uploads a new surface as the specified texture ID.
Similarly to
.Fn AG_GL_UploadTexture ,
texture coordinates are returned into
.Fa tc 
if non-NULL.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurface ,
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurfaceFrom ,
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurfaceGL ,
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurfaceFromGL ,
.Fn AG_GL_BlitSurfaceFlippedGL ,
.Fn AG_GL_BackupSurfaces ,
.Fn AG_GL_RestoreSurfaces
and
.Fn AG_GL_RenderToSurface
operations are generic OpenGL backends to the corresponding
.Xr AG_Driver 3
operations
.Fn blitSurface ,
.Fn blitSurfaceFrom ,
etc.

interface first appeared in Agar 1.4.0.
