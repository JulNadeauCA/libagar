.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_GlobalKeys
.Nd agar global hotkey bindings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface associates global keyboard shortcuts to callback functions.
Unlike widget actions or the
.Sq key-down
event (see
.Xr AG_Widget 3 ) ,
these keyboard shortcuts are effective regardless of current widget focus
state (although Agar widgets can always be configured to receive keyboard
events unfiltered).

.nr nS 0
.Fn AG_BindGlobalKey
arranges for the given function to be invoked whenever the user presses the
given key combination, regardless of widgets.
The
.Fn AG_BindGlobalKeyEv
variant accepts an
.Xr AG_Event 3
style function.
Note that arguments of
.Dv AG_KEY_ANY
and
.Dv AG_KEYMOD_ANY
are acceptable, in which case any key or key modifier will be matched (see
.Xr AG_KeySym 3 ) .
.Pp
.Fn AG_UnbindGlobalKey
removes the given key mapping.
.Fn AG_ClearGlobalKeys
removes all existing key mappings.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ExecGlobalKeys
is usually invoked internally.
If one or more callback routines are associated with the specified
key / modifier, they are executed and the function returns 1.
Otherwise, the function returns 0.

interface first appeared in Agar 1.0.
