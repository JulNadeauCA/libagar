.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_GlobalKeys
.Nd agar application-wide keyboard shortcuts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface associates application-wide keyboard shortcuts to specified
callback routines.
.Pp
Note that
.Nm
entirely ignores the status of Agar windows and widgets.
To implement keyboard operations specific to a given Agar window or widget,
one would instead use
.Xr AG_ActionOnKeyDown 3
or
.Xr AG_ActionOnKeyUp 3 .
For a more low-level interface to keyboard processing, the base
.Xr AG_Widget 3
class also provides the
.Sq key-down
and
.Sq key-up
event handlers.
.Sh INTERFACE
.nr nS 1
.Ft void
.Fn AG_BindGlobalKey "AG_KeySym key" "AG_KeyMod mod" "void (*fn)(void)"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_BindGlobalKeyEv "AG_KeySym key" "AG_KeyMod mod" "void (*fn)(AG_Event *)"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_BindStdGlobalKeys "void"

.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_ClearGlobalKeys "void"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Fn AG_BindGlobalKey
binds the specified routine to the given key combination.
Keys are represented by
.Ft AG_KeySym
enums, and acceptable values for
.Fa sym
and
.Fa mod
arguments are listed under
.Xr AG_KeySym 3
and
.Xr AG_KeyMod 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_BindGlobalKeyEv
variant accepts an
.Xr AG_Event 3
style function.
Note that arguments of
.Dv AG_KEY_ANY
and
.Dv AG_KEYMOD_ANY
are acceptable, in which case any key or key modifier will be matched.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_BindStdGlobalKeys
routine sets up the standard key bindings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "CTRL+EQUALS / META+EQUALS " -compact
.It CTRL+EQUALS / META+EQUALS
.Xr AG_ZoomIn 3
.It CTRL+MINUS / META+MINUS
.Xr AG_ZoomOut 3
.It CTRL+0 / META+0
.Xr AG_ZoomReset 3
.It CTRL+Q / META+Q
.Xr AG_QuitGUI 3
.It ESCAPE
.Xr AG_CloseFocusedWindow 3
.El
.Pp
.Fn AG_UnbindGlobalKey
removes the given key mapping.
.Fn AG_ClearGlobalKeys
removes all existing key mappings.
