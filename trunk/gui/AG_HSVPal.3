.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_HSVPal
.Nd agar HSV color wheel widget
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget is a HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color selector.
The user selects the hue using a circle, and the saturation/value using
a triangle.
.Pp
The widget can bind to floating-point hue, saturation, value and alpha
variables.
It can also bind to a pixel value (and matching
.Xr AG_PixelFormat 3 )
or an array of RGBA components in integer or floating-point format.
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
.Xr AG_Object 3 ->
.Xr AG_Widget 3 ->
.Nm .
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "AG_HSVPal *"
.Fn AG_HSVPalNew "AG_Widget *parent" "Uint flags"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_HSVPalNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a new
.Nm
widget.
Acceptable
.Fa flags
include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "AG_HSVPAL_NOPREVIEW "
.It AG_HSVPAL_NOALPHA
Disable the alpha component editor.
This flag is automatically set or cleared whenever
.Va pixel-format
is bound to a pixel format with or without alpha channel.
.It AG_HSVPAL_FORCE_NOALPHA
Disable the alpha component editor, regardless of whether the
pixel format includes alpha support.
.It AG_HSVPAL_NOPREVIEW
Disable the color preview band.
.It AG_HSVPAL_HFILL
Expand horizontally in parent (equivalent to invoking
.Xr AG_ExpandHoriz 3 ) .
.It AG_HSVPAL_VFILL
Expand vertically in parent (equivalent to invoking
.Xr AG_ExpandVert 3 ) .
.It AG_HSVPAL_EXPAND
Shorthand for
.Dv AG_HSVPAL_HFILL|AG_HSVPAL_VFILL .
.El
.Sh BINDINGS
The
.Nm
widget provides the following bindings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "AG_PixelFormat **pixel-format "
.It Va float *hue
Color hue (0..1).
.It Va float *saturation
Color saturation (0..1).
.It Va float *value
Color brightness (0..1).
.It Va float *alpha
Alpha component value (0..1).
.It Va AG_PixelFormat **pixel-format
Pointer to the
.Xr AG_PixelFormat 3
to use for generating the
.Va pixel
value.
The
.Dv AG_HSVPAL_NOALPHA
flag will be set automatically depending on the presence of an
alpha component in the newly bound format (use
.Dv AG_HSVPAL_FORCE_NOALPHA
to disable this test).
.It Va Uint32 *pixel
Resulting pixel value.
The pixel's components are extracted immediately when this binding is made
(using the current
.Va pixel-format )
so make sure to always bind
.Va pixel-format
prior to
.Va pixel .
.It Va void *RGBv
A three-element array containing the RGB components.
Acceptable binding types include FLOAT and DOUBLE, INT and UINT8.
For floating point types, the values are scaled to 0.0-1.0.
For integral types, the values are scaled to 0-255.
.It Va void *RGBAv
Same as above, except that the array has 4 elements where the last element
is the alpha component.
.El
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget reacts to the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 25n
.It mouse-button-*
Edit the selected RGBA component.
.It bound
If a new
.Va pixel
binding is made, the pixel's components are extracted and the
.Va hue ,
.Va saturation ,
.Va value
and
.Va alpha
values are updated to reflect an approximation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
widget generates the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 2n
.It Fn h-changed "void"
The hue has changed.
.It Fn sv-changed
The saturation or the value has changed.
.El
.Sh TROUBLETONS
The conversion between integer RGB and HSV triplets is not reversible without
loss of precision.
In cases where it is desirable to maintain the same hue throughout changes in
saturation, the color should be stored in HSV format.
