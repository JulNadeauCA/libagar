.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" IMAGE(http://libagar.org/widgets/AG_DriverGLX.png, "The Xorg/glx driver")
After having initialized the Agar-Core library with
.Xr AG_InitCore 3 ,
Agar-GUI applications must initialize the GUI system and select a driver.
.Sh AVAILABLE DRIVERS
As of Agar-1.5.0, the driver modules included in the distribution are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "sdlfb " -compact
.It glx
Native X11 interface (GL); see
.Xr AG_DriverGLX 3 .
.It wgl
Native Microsoft Windows interface (GL); see
.Xr AG_DriverWGL 3 .
.It cocoa
Native MacOS X Cocoa interface (GL); see
.Xr AG_DriverCocoa 3 .
.It sdlfb
SDL 1.x interface (framebuffer); see
.Xr AG_DriverSDLFB 3 .
.It sdlgl
SDL 1.x interface (GL); see
.Xr AG_DriverSDLGL 3 .

The
.Fn AG_InitGraphics
function initializes the Agar GUI system.
If the
.Fa drivers
argument is NULL (the usual case), Agar selects the "best" driver available
on the current platform.
If
.Fa drivers
is non-NULL, it should be a comma-separated list of drivers, in order of
preference (the special strings "<OpenGL>" and "<SDL>" may be used to select
any driver with GL or SDL capability).
The list of compiled-in drivers may be obtained by calling
.Xr AG_ListDriverNames 3 .
Driver-specific parameters (which are documented on the driver's respective
manual page) may be specified as a colon-separated list between
parentheses:
.Bd -literal
	sdlfb,sdlgl(width=640:height=480:depth=32)
	<OpenGL>(stereo=1)
	<SDL>(width=640:height=480:depth=32)
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_DestroyGraphics
routine shuts down and releases all resources allocated by the Agar-GUI
library.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_InitGUI
routine provides an alternative to
.Fn AG_InitGraphics ,
which does not create any driver instance on initialization.
While
.Fn AG_InitGraphics
is limited to a single Agar driver instance, specialized applications may
need to create multiple driver instances (e.g., an Agar application using
X11 may establish multiple connections to multiple X servers).
This may be done by calling
.Fn AG_InitGUI ,
and creating one or more driver instances with
.Xr AG_DriverOpen 3 .

function first appeared in Agar 1.0, and was replaced by
.Fn AG_InitGraphics
in Agar 1.4.
