.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_InitVideoSDL
.Nd agar SDL 1.x interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" IMAGE(http://libagar.org/widgets/AG_DriverSDLFB.png, "The sdlfb driver")
If Agar has been compiled with SDL 1.x support (--with-sdl), the "sdlfb"
and "sdlgl" driver modules become available, and the GUI system can be
attached to an existing SDL display context.
.Pp
Note: If Agar is to create a new SDL display context, one should use a normal
.Xr AG_InitGraphics 3
call instead (using "<SDL>" as argument if a SDL-capable driver module is
required).
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_InitVideoSDL "SDL_Surface *display" "Uint flags"
.Pp
.Ft "int"
.Fn AG_SetVideoSurfaceSDL "SDL_Surface *display"

.Fn AG_SetVideoResizeCallback "void (*fn)(Uint w, Uint h))"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_InitVideoSDL
function initializes the GUI to attach to an existing SDL display surface.
If the specified surface has the
.Dv SDL_OPENGL
flag, the GL-capable "sdlgl" driver module (see
.Xr AG_DriverSDLGL 3 )
is selected.
Otherwise, the direct frame-buffer "sdlfb" driver (see
.Xr AG_DriverSDLFB 3 )
is used.
The
.Fn AG_InitVideoSDL
function accepts the following
.Fa flags
options:
.Bl -tag -width "AG_VIDEO_OPENGL_OR_SDL "
.It AG_VIDEO_HWSURFACE
Request a hardware frame buffer (pass
.Dv SDL_HWSURFACE ) .
.It AG_VIDEO_ASYNCBLIT
Enable asynchronous blitting updates (pass
.Dv SDL_ASYNCBLIT ) .
.It AG_VIDEO_ANYFORMAT
Disable emulation of surface depth (pass
.Dv SDL_ANYFORMAT ) .
.It AG_VIDEO_HWPALETTE
Exclusive palette access (pass
.Dv SDL_HWPALETTE ) .
.It AG_VIDEO_DOUBLEBUF
Enable double-buffering in frame buffer mode.
.It AG_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN
Start up application in full-screen mode
.It AG_VIDEO_RESIZABLE
If a window manager is available, request that the application be
resizable.
.It AG_VIDEO_NOFRAME
If a window manager is available, disable window decorations.
.It AG_VIDEO_BGPOPUPMENU
Whenever the user right-clicks on an area not covered by an Agar window,
display a standard pop-up menu with the list of active windows.
.It AG_VIDEO_OPENGL
Require OpenGL mode.
If OpenGL is not available, initialization will fail.
.It AG_VIDEO_OPENGL_OR_SDL
Try OpenGL mode if available, otherwise fallback to SDL frame-buffer mode.
.It AG_VIDEO_OVERLAY
Run in OpenGL "overlay" mode.
In this mode, Agar will never clear the background or swap GL buffers.
Before rendering itself, Agar will also save the current OpenGL state and
restore it completely once rendering is complete.
Internally, this option causes the
.Dv AG_DRIVER_SW_OVERLAY
option to be set (see
.Xr AG_DriverSw 3 ) .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SetVideoSurfaceSDL
function can be used to reattach to a different (e.g., a newly resized)
SDL display surface without reinitializing the GUI.
.Pp
Note: The
.Fn AG_InitVideoSDL
and
.Fn AG_SetVideoSurfaceSDL
functions are only available if Agar has been compiled with SDL 1.x support
(to find out, include "<agar/config/have_sdl.h>" and test
for
.Dv HAVE_SDL ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ResizeDisplay
function resizes the video display to the specified dimensions in pixels.
.Fn AG_SetVideoResizeCallback
registers a callback function which will be invoked whenever the display is
resized.
Both of these functions are only applicable to single-window drivers.
