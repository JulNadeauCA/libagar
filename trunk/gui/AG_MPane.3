.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_MPane

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget divides space into a set of
.Xr AG_Box 3
partitions much like the
.Xr AG_Pane 3
widget, except that up to 4 partitions are allowed.
It is possible to switch during different partition layouts at runtime,
making
.Nm
useful for 3D modeling applications.
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
.Xr AG_Object 3 ->
.Xr AG_Widget 3 ->
.Nm .
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "AG_MPane *"
.Fn AG_MPaneNew "AG_Widget *parent" "enum ag_mpane_layout layout" "Uint flags"

The
.Fn AG_MPaneNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a
.Nm
widget.
.Fn AG_MPaneInit
initializes a
.Nm
widget.

argument include:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
enum ag_mpane_layout {
	AG_MPANE1,		/* Single view */
	AG_MPANE2V,		/* Dual views (left/right) */
	AG_MPANE2H,		/* Dual views (top/bottom) */
	AG_MPANE2L1R,		/* Two views left, one view right */
	AG_MPANE1L2R,		/* One view left, two views right */
	AG_MPANE2T1B,		/* Two views top, one view bottom */
	AG_MPANE1T2B,		/* One view top, two views bottom */
	AG_MPANE3L1R,		/* Three views left, one view right */
	AG_MPANE1L3R,		/* One view left, three views right */
	AG_MPANE3T1B,		/* Three views top, one view bottom */
	AG_MPANE1T3B,		/* One view top, three views bottom */
	AG_MPANE4		/* Four views */
};

.Fa flags
may include:

#define AG_MPANE_FRAMES    0x04	/* Decorative frames */
#define AG_MPANE_FORCE_DIV 0x08	/* Always divide (not user-resizable) */

.Pp
The
.Fn AG_MPaneSetLayout
function changes the current layout, recreating all the
.Xr AG_Box 3
partitions from scratch.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget neither reacts to nor generates any event.

.Xr AG_Window 3
.Sh HISTORY

Unlike with
.Xr AG_Pane 3 ,
it is impossible to reuse existing containers.
