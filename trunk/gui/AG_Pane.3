.Sh NAME
.Nm AG_Pane
.Nd agar paned container widget
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget is a dual container widget with a separator that is movable by the user.
The two partitions are containers of type
.Xr AG_Box 3 .
Depending on the application, partitions may or may not be allowed to shrink
to zero size.

.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_PaneNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a new
.Nm
widget.
.Fn AG_PaneInit
initializes a preallocated
.Nm
widget, where
.Fa type
is one of:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
enum ag_pane_type {
	AG_PANE_HORIZ,
	AG_PANE_VERT
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
may include:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
#define AG_PANE_DIV1FILL	0x04	/* Expand div1 (default is div2) */
#define AG_PANE_FRAME		0x08	/* Decorative frames */
#define AG_PANE_DIV		0x40	/* Initially divide area in two */
#define AG_PANE_FORCE_DIV	0x80	/* Force divide area in two */
.Ed
.Pp
By default, the first division will be sized appropriately and the second
division will expand to fill available space; that behavior can be changed
with the
.Dv AG_PANE_DIV1FILL
flag.
If
.Dv AG_PANE_DIV
is given, space is initially divided by two.
With
.Dv AG_PANE_FORCE_DIV ,
the space is always divided by two and the user cannot move the separator.
.Pp
The
.Dv AG_PANE_FRAME
flag enables
.Dv AG_BOX_FRAME
on the partitions, which draws a frame.
The depth of the frame can be adjusted by invoking
.Xr AG_BoxSetDepth 3
on the partitions.
.Pp
By default, the two
.Xr AG_Box 3
sub-containers of
.Nm
are created automatically.
.Fn AG_PaneAttachBox
allows existing boxes to be attached and re-used.
.Fa which
must be 0 or 1.
.Fn AG_PaneAttachBoxes
is a variant that accepts two box arguments.
.Pp
.Fn AG_PaneSetDividerWidth
sets the width of the divider widget in pixels.
.Pp
By default, the user is allowed to move the separator such that one of the
two partitions can be shrunk to zero.
.Fn AG_PaneSetDivisionMin
prevents this by setting a minimal geometry in pixels for the given partition
.Fa which
(which must be either 0 or 1).
If the value -1 is given, no minimum is set.
.Pp
The separator can also be moved programmatically with the
.Fn AG_PaneMoveDivider
function.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget reacts to the following events:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "window-mousebuttondown "
.It window-mousemotion
.It window-mousebuttonup
.It window-mousebuttondown
Move the separator, resizing the partitions.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
widget does not generate any event.
