.Nd agar pixmap display widget
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
widget displays an image in pixmap format.
It is frequently used along with
.Xr AG_Fixed 3
to display interface decorations.
.Pp
In OpenGL mode, the image surfaces are uploaded to the texture unit as
they are mapped or updated.
.Pp
Small animations can be efficiently displayed by mapping one surface per frame
and invoking
.Fn AG_PixmapSetSurface
from a timer with
.Xr AG_Timeout 3 .

The
.Fn AG_PixmapNew
function creates a new
.Nm
not linked to any surface.
The initial geometry of the widget is defined by the
.Fa width
and
.Fa height
parameters.
The following
.Fa flags
are accepted:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "AG_PIXMAP_RESCALE "
.Dv AG_PIXMAP_RESCALE
Rescale image to fit widget size.
.El
.Pp
The following functions create a new
.Nm
with an image obtained from the given source.
When using these constructors, the geometry of the widget is set to
that of the source image.
.Pp
.Fn AG_PixmapFromSurface
maps an existing
.Xr AG_Surface 3
to surface 0.
The surface must remain valid until the widget is destroyed.
The
.Fn AG_PixmapFromSurfaceCopy
variant instead creates and manages a copy of the surface.
.Fn AG_PixmapFromSurfaceScaled
uses rescaled copy of the surface.

The
.Nm
widget can map multiple surfaces and switch between them.
To add a new surface, use
.Fn AG_PixmapAddSurface ,
.Fn AG_PixmapAddSurfaceCopy
or
.Fn AG_PixmapAddSurfaceScaled .
.Pp
.Fn AG_PixmapSetSurface
changes the currently visible surface to another surface that has been
previously mapped with
.Fn AG_PixmapAddSurface* .
To replace an existing mapped surface, use
.Fn AG_PixmapReplaceSurface
or
.Fn AG_PixmapReplaceSurfaceScaled
with the name of the surface.
.Pp
If you need to modify the contents of a previously mapped surface, it is
necessary to call
.Fn AG_PixmapUpdateSurface
afterwards.
It has no effect in direct video mode, but it causes the texture to be
re-uploaded to the graphics hardware in OpenGL mode.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PixmapReplaceCurrentSurface ,
.Fn AG_PixmapReplaceCurrentSurfaceScaled
and
.Fn AG_PixmapUpdateCurrentSurface
variants operate on the currently selected (visible) surface.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_PixmapSetCoords
function changes the source coordinates of the active surface.
The default is [0,0].
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
widget neither reacts to nor generates any event.
.Sh STRUCTURE DATA
For the
.Ft AG_Pixmap
object:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "int s, t "
.It Ft int s, t
Source surface coordinates.
Can be set using
.Fn AG_PixmapSetCoords .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment displays an existing
.Xr AG_Surface 3 .
It packs
.Nm
in a
.Xr AG_Scrollview 3
widget, allowing the user to pan the view:
.Bd -literal
AG_Scrollview *sv;
AG_Pixmap *px;

sv = AG_ScrollviewNew(window, AG_SCROLLVIEW_BY_MOUSE);
AG_Expand(sv);
px = AG_PixmapFromSurface(sv, 0, mySurface);
.Ed
.Pp
Assuming Agar was compiled with support for the SDL library, the following
code fragment displays an
.Xr SDL_Surface 3 .
It uses
.Dv AG_PIXMAP_RESCALE
to scale the image to fit the widget geometry:
.Bd -literal
AG_Pixmap *px;
SDL_Surface *sSDL;
AG_Surface *s;

sSDL = SDL_LoadBMP("foo.bmp");
s = AG_SurfaceFromSDL(sSDL);
px = AG_PixmapFromSurface(sv, AG_PIXMAP_RESCALE,
    AG_SurfaceFromSDL(sSDL));

.Pp
The
.Pa demos/fixedres
demo in the Agar distribution illustrates the use of
.Xr AG_Fixed 3
and
.Nm
in a game-style interface.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
widget first appeared in Agar 1.0.
