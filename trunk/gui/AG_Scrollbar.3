The
.Fn AG_ScrollbarNew
function allocates, initializes, and attaches a new
.Nm
widget.
.Fa type
defines the orientation of the scrollbar:
.Bd -literal
enum ag_scrollbar_type {
	AG_SCROLLBAR_HORIZ,
	AG_SCROLLBAR_VERT
};
.Ed
.Pp
There are currently no
.Fa flags
specific to this widget.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ScrollbarSetBarSize
function sets the size of the scrollbar in pixels.
In scrolling applications, the scrollbar size is usually computed from the
ratio between the visible area and the total area that can be displayed.
.Fn AG_ScrollbarGetBarSize
returns the current size of the scrollbar.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ScrollbarSetButtonSize
requests a preferred size for the scrollbar buttons.
.Fn AG_ScrollbarGetButtonSize
returns the current button size, which may be less than previously requested.
.Pp
If the current value of the variables is such that the scrollbar is any useful,
.Fn AG_ScrollbarVisible
returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ScrollbarSetDecFn
and
.Fn AG_ScrollbarSetIncFn
functions configure a callback routine that will be invoked when the user
presses the decrement (up/left) button and the increment (down/right) buttons.
A single
.Ft int
argument is passed to the callback (1 = pressed, 0 = released).
