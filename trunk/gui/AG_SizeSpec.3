.Nm AG_SizeSpec
.Nd agar widget size specification
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Some functions related to Agar widgets accept specially parsed string
arguments which are used to specify relative sizes of visual elements.
For instance, the
.Xr AG_TableAddCol 3
function takes an optional
.Fa size_spec
argument for defining the initial width of a column.
.Pp
Sizes can be given in pixels ("Npx"), percentiles ("N%"), or width of text
as rendered using the default font ("<Text>").
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width "<Some text> "
.It "100px"
Size to 100 pixels.
.It "50%"
Size to 50 percent.
The meaning is dependent on the widget.
For example, for
.Xr AG_TableAddCol 3
this is relative to the full width of the table.
.It "<Some text>"
Size to the width in pixels of "Some text", as rendered using the current
default font.
