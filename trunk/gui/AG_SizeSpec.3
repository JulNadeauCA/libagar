.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Some functions related to Agar widgets accept specially parsed string
arguments which are used to specify relative sizes of visual elements
which cannot be automatically determined by Agar.
.Pp
For example, the
.Xr AG_Table 3
widget provides an
.Xr AG_TableAddCol 3
function which accepts an optional
.Fa size_spec
argument for defining the initial width of a column.
.Pp
The following formats are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width "<Some text> "
.It Npx
Number of pixels.
For example, "100px" will size to 100 pixels.
.It <Some text>
Size to the minimum amount of space required to completely display the
given text, as rendered using the default font.
.It N%
Percentage of space (widget-specific).
For example, "50%" in
.Xr AG_TableAddCol 3
will size a new column to half of the available space.
.It -
Expand to fill any available space remaining (widget-specific).
