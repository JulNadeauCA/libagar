.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" IMAGE(http://libagar.org/widgets/AG_Style.png, "Alternate style sheet")
The
.Nm
interface allows Agar GUI style attributes to be loaded from a cascading
style sheet.
Agar style sheets use a particular syntax.
Style sheets contain blocks of attributes which are applicable to specific
Agar widget classes (and possibly, specific widget states as well).
For example:
.Bd -literal
AG_Button {
	# Set colors for default state
	color: rgb(125,125,125);
	text-color: rgb(0,0,0);

	# Set colors for "disabled" state
	color#disabled: rgb(200,200,200);
	text-color#disabled: rgb(125,125,125);

	# Set colors for mouse hover state
	color#hover: rgb(200,250,200);
	text-color#hover: rgb(125,150,125);
}
.Ed
.Pp
By default, a widget instance inherits its style attributes from its parent.
The syntax allows certain attributes, such as "font-size" and "color" to
be specified in relation to the parent.
For example:
.Bd -literal
	font-size: 50%;			# Half of parent font size
	color: hsv(100%,50%,100%);	# Half of parent saturation
	color: hsv(100%,100%,75%);	# 3/4 of parent value

.\" SYNC WITH AG_Widget(3)
.\"
The generic
.Ft AG_Widget
class defines the basic attributes "font-family", "font-size", "font-weight",
"font-style", "color", "text-color", "line-color", "shape-color" and
"border-color".
For a full description of those attributes, refer to the
.Dq STYLE PROPERTIES
of the
.Xr AG_Widget 3
manual page.
Other Agar widget classes may define their own style attributes (these
should be documented under the
.Dq STYLE PROPERTIES
section of the widget's manual page).
.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_InitStyleSheet "AG_StyleSheet *ss"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_DestroyStyleSheet "AG_StyleSheet *css"
.Pp
.Ft "AG_StyleSheet *"
.Fn AG_LoadStyleSheet "AG_StyleSheet *css" "const char *path"
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn AG_LookupStyleSheet "AG_StyleSheet *css" "void *widget" "const char *key" "char **rv"
.nr nS 0
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_InitStyleSheet
function initializes the given
.Nm
as an empty style sheet.
.Fn AG_DestroyStyleSheet
releases all resources allocated by a style sheet.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_LoadStyleSheet
function loads a style sheet from
.Fa path .
On success, a newly allocated
.Nm
is returned.
If
.Fa path
begins with a "_" character,
.Fn AG_LoadStyleSheet
will search for a statically-compiled stylesheet
(i.e., "_agStyleDefault" is always available).
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_LookupStyleSheet
routine searches the style sheet for the specified attribute
(identified by
.Fa key ) .
If the style sheet defines an attribute applicable to the specified widget
instance (the
.Fa widget
argument), its value is returned into
.Fa rv .
