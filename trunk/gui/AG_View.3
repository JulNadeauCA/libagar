.Nm AG_View
.Nd agar-gui display interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
#include <agar/core.h>
#include <agar/gui.h>
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar
.Nm
interface provides low-level video functions to the Agar GUI.
Every display is described by the
.Nm
structure, and is associated with a set of GUI windows (see the
.Dq WINDOW SYSTEM
section).
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface also implements a series of macros for basic pixel operations, and
a number of utility routines for surface and texture manipulation.

.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_InitVideo
function initializes the graphic display if there is one available,
returning 0 on success and -1 on failure.
Acceptable
.Fa flags
include:
.Bl -tag -width "AG_VIDEO_OPENGL_OR_SDL "
.It AG_VIDEO_HWSURFACE
Request hardware framebuffer, whenever possible.
.It AG_VIDEO_ASYNCBLIT
If SDL is selected as a back-end, pass the
.Dv SDL_ASYNCBLIT
flag to
.Xr SDL_SetVideoMode 3 .
.It AG_VIDEO_ANYFORMAT
In SDL mode, avoid emulating surface of requested depth if not available.
.It AG_VIDEO_HWPALETTE
In color-index mode, request exclusive palette access.
.It AG_VIDEO_DOUBLEBUF
If
.Dv AG_VIDEO_HWSURFACE
is used, enable hardware double-buffering.
.It AG_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN
Start in full screen mode.
.It AG_VIDEO_RESIZABLE
If display is windowed, request a resizable window.
.It AG_VIDEO_NOFRAME
If display is windowed, request a frame-less window.
.It AG_VIDEO_BGPOPUPMENU
When the user clicks on the background, display a generic popup menu,
by default listing the minimize windows.
.It AG_VIDEO_OPENGL
Request OpenGL mode and fail if it is not available.
.It AG_VIDEO_OPENGL_OR_SDL
Request OpenGL mode if it is available, and fallback to SDL.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_DestroyVideo
function frees all resources allocated to the GUI.
It is invoked automatically by
.Xr AG_Destroy 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ResizeDisplay
function attempts to resize the display, assuming that the underlying
graphics system allows such an operation.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_SetRefreshRate
function sets the maximum refresh rate, given in frames/second.
The stock event loop function
.Xr AG_EventLoop_FixedFPS 3
will attempt to draw exactly this number of frames per second and then idle
as much as possible.
This value is only advisory, alternate or user-defined event loop functions
may ignore it entirely.
.Pp
.Fn AG_SetVideoResizeCallback
configures a routine that will be invoked, whenever the display is resized
(assuming the display is resizable).
The
.Fa w ,
.Fa h
arguments are the new geometry in pixels.
.Pp
.Fn AG_BindGlobalKey
arranges for the given function to be invoked whenever the user presses the
given key combination, regardless of widgets.
The
.Fn AG_BindGlobalKeyEv
variant accepts an
.Xr AG_Event 3
style function.
.Fn AG_UnbindGlobalKey
removes the given key mapping, returning 0 on success and -1 if no such
mapping exists.
.Pp
.Fn AG_ClearGlobalKeys
removes all existing key mappings.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ViewUpdateFB
routine queues the update of a video region for the next event processing
cycle.
If the current display mode is not framebuffer-based,
.Fn AG_ViewUpdateFB
is a no-op.
.Pp
.Fn AG_LockView
and
.Fn AG_UnlockView
acquire and release the locks protecting direct framebuffer access.
If the display is not framebuffer-based or direct access does not require
locking, these functions are no-ops.
.Sh FRAMEBUFFER-SPECIFIC OPERATIONS
The following operations are only available when the current display surface
provides an accessible framebuffer.
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL "Uint8 *p" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2 "int x" "int y" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED "int x" "int y" "Uint32 c"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ViewUpdateFB "const AG_Rect *r"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL
and
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2
macros sets the value of a display pixel using a similar interface to
.Xr AG_PUT_PIXEL 3
and
.Xr AG_PUT_PIXEL2 3 .
The operation is optimized for the pixel format of the display surface.
It is unsafe to invoke these macros unless the current display surface is
framebuffer-based.
.Pp
.Fn AG_VIEW_PUT_PIXEL2_CLIPPED
tests the given coordinates against the current clipping rectangle (see
.Xr AG_WidgetPushClipRect 3 ,
.Xr AG_WidgetPopClipRect 3 ,
.Xr AG_SetClipRect 3 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ViewUpdateFB
routine marks the specified video region for subsequent video updates.
.Sh OPENGL-SPECIFIC OPERATIONS
The following operations are only available when the current display surface
has an associated OpenGL context.
.Pp
.nr nS 1
.Ft "GLuint"
.Fn AG_SurfaceTexture "AG_Surface *src" "GLfloat *texcoord"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_UpdateTexture "AG_Surface *src" "GLuint name"
.Pp
.Ft "AG_Surface *"
.Fn AG_CaptureGLView "void"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
.Fn AG_SurfaceTexture
creates an OpenGL texture from
.Fa src ,
returning the GL surface handel.
Texture coordinates (described as 4
.Ft float
values) is returned into
.Fa texcoord ,
is non-NULL.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_UpdateTexture
routine updates the contents of an existing OpenGL texture from the contents
of a specified
.Ft AG_Surface .
.Fa name
specifies the GL texture handle.
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_CaptureGLView
function captures the contents of the current OpenGL display into an
.Ft AG_Surface .
The surface must be freed after use.
.Sh WINDOW SYSTEM
.nr nS 1
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ViewAttach "AG_Window *child"
.Pp
.Ft "void"
.Fn AG_ViewDetach "AG_Window *child"
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn AG_ViewDetachQueued "void"
.Pp
.Ft "AG_Window *"
.Fn AG_FindWindow "char *name"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The Agar GUI operates on a set of windows which are associated with an
.Nm .
For more details, see
.Xr AG_Window 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_ViewAttach
function attaches the window pointed to by
.Fa child
to the view.
The
.Fn AG_ViewDetach
function detaches the window pointed to by
.Fa child
from the view by adding it to the detach queue.
The detachment will be performed later by
.Fa AG_ViewDetachQueued .
.Pp
The
.Fn AG_FindWindow
functions looks for a window identified by
.Fa name
and return NULL if there is no such window.
.Sh STRUCTURE DATA
For the
.Ft AG_View
object:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "TAILQ windows "
.It Ft int w, h
Dimensions of the display in pixels (read-only).
.It Ft int depth

.It Ft Uint rNom
Nominal refresh rate (exact interpretation left to event loop).
.It Ft AG_Mutex lock
Lock on GUI window lists.
