This documents the changes we made to SPARSE library : http://sparse.sourceforge.net/
We currently use SPARSE 1.4b.
Changes to vanilla SPARSE :
* changed the includes (basically, include "../m.h" in every .c, and include nothing in .h)
* #define spREAL M_Real to use M's real type
* uncapitalized file names
* removed some unused prototypes, and silenced some warnings
