This module provides an object-oriented Perl interface to the Agar GUI toolkit
and its standard widgets. It also allows new widgets to be written in pure
Perl. Agar is an integration-friendly, extensible and highly portable library
which works efficiently with different graphics APIs such as SDL and OpenGL.

The Agar library must be installed on your system for this module to compile.
