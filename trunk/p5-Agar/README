This module provides an object-oriented Perl interface to the Agar GUI toolkit
and its standard widgets. It also allows new widgets to be written in pure
Perl. Agar is an integration-friendly and extensible GUI library that has
been ported to a wide array of platforms. Agar can render itself efficiently
using OpenGL (e.g., "glx, "wgl", "sdlgl" drivers) or software framebuffers
(e.g., "sdlfb").

The Agar library must be installed on your system for this module to compile.
