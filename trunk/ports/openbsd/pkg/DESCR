The Agar project produces a portable and window-system independent
GUI toolkit for SDL/OpenGL. The Agar core library implements an
object system used by applications such as editors, games and
simulations. The distribution also includes libraries for vector
and raster graphics manipulations, game objects and 3D scene graphs.

Packages can be built with additional FLAVORs:

  threads: Agar built with support for multithreading.
  net:     Agar built with networking capabilities.
  gl:      Agar built with OpenGL support.
  debug:   Agar built with debugging code.
