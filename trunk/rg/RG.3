.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Agar-RG library operates on raster graphics.
The library implements the
.Ft RG_Tileset
object, which acts as a container for graphics resources:
.Bl -tag -width "Animations "
.It Tiles
Transparent graphic surfaces, generated from a set of instructions (or
.Sq features ) .
See
.Xr RG_Tile 3 .
.It Animations
Simple 2D animations also generated from a set of instructions.
See
.Xr RG_Anim 3 .
.It Textures
References to tiles with additional information related to texturing.
See
.Xr RG_Texture 3 .
.It Pixmaps
Transparent graphic surfaces used internally.
Pixmaps can be shared by multiple tiles.
See
.Xr RG_Pixmap 3 .
.It Sketches
Vector drawings used internally.
See
.Xr RG_Sketch 3 .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
structure also provides tiles, animations and textures with unique integer
names, such that items can be added or removed on the fly without invalidating
existing external references.
To take advantage of this feature, code should reference tiles and animations
using the
.Va tiletbl
and
.Va animtbl
members of the
.Nm
structure.
.Sh INHERITANCE HIERARCHY
.Xr AG_Object 3 ->

.Sh INITIALIZATION
.nr nS 1
.Ft "RG_Tileset *"
.Fn RG_TilesetNew "void *parent" "const char *name" "Uint flags"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn RG_TilesetNew
function allocates and initializes a new
.Nm
object and attaches it to
.Fa parent
if not NULL.
There are currently no
.Fa flags
defined.
.Sh ACCESSING RESOURCES

.Pp
.Ft "RG_Pixmap *"
.Fn RG_TilesetResvPixmap "RG_Tileset *tileset" "const char *tileset_name" "const char *name"
.Pp
.nr nS 0
The
.Fn RGTILE
and
.Fn RGANIM
macros return the tile or animation of the given name.
If debugging is enabled, a non-existing resource will trigger a fatal
error.
.Pp
.Fn RG_LookupTile
and
.Fn RG_LookupAnim
search for a tile or animation with the given name.
If one is found, it is returned into
.Fa rTile
or
.Fa rAnim .
The function returns 0 on success and -1 if no such tile exists.
.Pp
.Fn RG_TilesetFindTile ,
.Fn RG_TilesetFindSketch
and
.Fn RG_TilesetFindPixmap
search for the given resource using the user-provided name string,
returning a pointer to the element on success and NULL on failure.
The
.Fn RG_TilesetResv*
variants use the VFS path name for the
.Nm
object itself.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in Agar 1.3.
