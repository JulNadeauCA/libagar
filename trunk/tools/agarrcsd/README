What is agarrcsd?
-----------------
When Agar-Core is compiled with network support (--enable-network), the
Object system provides a lightweight, built-in revision control system
which allows Object datasets to be exported, imported and compared
(possibly graphically) against a remote repository, served by agarrcsd,
over the network.

See the manual page, agarrcsd(8) for a detailed description of the
protocol.

What are the system requirements?
---------------------------------
agarrcsd requires a POSIX-compliant operating system.

How do I use agarrcsd?
----------------------
First create a Unix account for the daemon:

    # useradd -d /var/agarrcsd -m _agarrcsd

To configure the user accounts, start agarrcsd in administrative mode
(as the _agarrcsd user):

    $ agarrcsd -d /var/agarrcsd -a

When you are done with configuration, start up the daemon:

    $ agarrcsd -d /var/agarrcsd

The server should now be accepting connections from Agar-RCS clients,
on the default port (6785).
